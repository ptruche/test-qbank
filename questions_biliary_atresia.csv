1,Biliary Atresia,"A term infant with persistent jaundice at 3 weeks has pale stools noted by the parents and dark urine. On exam the infant appears well, with a firm, enlarged liver. Which next step best aligns with an efficient workup strategy for suspected biliary atresia?",Observe for 2 more weeks; physiologic jaundice can last to 6 weeks,"Order fractionated bilirubin, liver profile, and begin the cholestasis evaluation algorithm",Immediate HIDA scan without any other testing,Start ursodeoxycholic acid and repeat labs in 1 month,Schedule elective clinic follow‑up at 2 months,B,"Persistent jaundice beyond two weeks of life, especially when accompanied by acholic stools and dark urine, warrants **immediate evaluation for neonatal cholestasis** rather than watchful waiting. Biliary atresia (BA) is a time‑sensitive diagnosis in which early recognition improves outcomes after surgical intervention. 

A structured workup should begin with **fractionated (direct) bilirubin** and liver tests, as recommended in standard cholestasis algorithms. Imaging and other studies follow, but no single preoperative test is definitive; the diagnosis ultimately relies on cholangiography when suspicion remains high. Delays in evaluation risk missing the optimal operative window."
2,Biliary Atresia,"For infants with suspected biliary atresia, which test is considered the gold standard for diagnosis?",Abdominal ultrasound demonstrating absent gallbladder,Percutaneous liver biopsy showing bile duct plugging,Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA) after phenobarbital priming,Intraoperative or percutaneous cholangiogram demonstrating atresia,Serum gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) markedly elevated,D,"While multiple modalities contribute to evaluation, **cholangiography** remains the **gold standard** for diagnosing BA because no combination of other tests approaches 100% sensitivity and specificity. Ultrasound, HIDA, and biopsy can support the diagnosis, narrow differentials, or exclude mimics, but are not definitive on their own. 

When noninvasive testing cannot rule out BA, **operative cholangiogram** (often combined with liver biopsy) is performed to confirm the diagnosis and proceed to definitive therapy if indicated."
3,Biliary Atresia,Which finding on initial abdominal ultrasound most strongly supports biliary atresia?,Gallbladder sludge and wall thickening,Triangular cord sign at the porta hepatis,Dilated common bile duct measuring 6 mm,Normal‑appearing gallbladder with mobile stones,Hepatic hemangioma adjacent to the portal vein,B,"Ultrasound in BA primarily **excludes other causes** (e.g., choledochal cyst) and looks for supportive features. The **triangular cord sign**—an echogenic density anterior to the portal vein—reflects fibrotic remnants of the biliary tree and is relatively specific for BA. 

Other ultrasound findings such as sludge or stones point toward different pathologies. A dilated extrahepatic duct favors obstructive causes like choledochal cyst, not atresia. Ultrasound alone, however, is not diagnostic and must be integrated with the overall cholestasis workup."
4,Biliary Atresia,"Regarding hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA) in suspected biliary atresia, which statement is most accurate?",A positive HIDA scan (no excretion) confirms BA with near‑perfect specificity,HIDA is unnecessary and should be avoided in all infants with cholestasis,HIDA may be used with phenobarbital priming but cannot alone rule in or out BA,"If HIDA shows excretion into bowel, the infant still likely has BA",HIDA is superior to cholangiogram for diagnostic accuracy,C,"HIDA can be included in preoperative evaluation and is often performed after several days of **phenobarbital priming** to enhance tracer excretion. However, **HIDA lacks the sensitivity and specificity** to definitively diagnose or exclude BA by itself. Non‑excretion can occur in other severe hepatocellular diseases, and some infants with BA may demonstrate equivocal results. 

Therefore, HIDA is an adjunct; persistent suspicion should prompt **cholangiography**, the diagnostic gold standard."
5,Biliary Atresia,Which statement regarding timing of Kasai portoenterostomy most closely reflects outcome data?,Results are independent of age at operation,Best outcomes are achieved when surgery occurs before ~45 days of life,Surgery after 120 days has outcomes equivalent to surgery at 30 days,Waiting until 90 days ensures appropriate growth before surgery,"Delaying surgery allows the ducts to ‘mature,’ improving bile flow",B,"Outcomes after **Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy** correlate with **younger age at surgery**. While <90 days has long been cited as a threshold, contemporary data advocate for **even earlier intervention (before ~45 days)** when possible, with higher rates of postoperative clearance of jaundice and improved native‑liver survival. 

Delays driven by prolonged “watchful waiting” for neonatal jaundice risk missing this optimal window and increase the likelihood of eventual transplantation."
6,Biliary Atresia,"Following a Kasai portoenterostomy, which postoperative marker at 3 months is commonly used to judge success?",Albumin > 2.0 g/dL,Direct bilirubin < 2 mg/dL,ALT < 120 U/L,GGT normalized,INR < 1.2 without supplementation,B,"After Kasai, **falling bilirubin** is a practical gauge of bile drainage. A widely used target is **bilirubin < 2 mg/dL by 3 months** post‑op. Achieving pigmented stools within two weeks and steadily improving cholestasis correlate with better long‑term outcomes. 

Transaminases and cholestatic enzymes may lag or fluctuate; synthetic function metrics also matter but bilirubin trajectory is the most direct surrogate of biliary outflow restoration."
7,Biliary Atresia,"In the years following a successful Kasai, which complication remains a common risk and can threaten long‑term native liver survival?",Acute acalculous cholecystitis,Cholangitis,Splenic artery aneurysm rupture,Caroli disease,Wilson disease,B,"**Cholangitis** is a well‑recognized complication after Kasai, particularly in the first few years but also later in children who maintain their native liver. Recurrent episodes contribute to progressive hepatic injury and can precipitate clinical decline. 

Management focuses on prompt recognition and antibiotic therapy; preventive strategies vary by center. Ongoing surveillance is essential even in apparently well‑draining patients."
8,Biliary Atresia,A school‑aged child with BA post‑Kasai presents with thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. What does this most likely indicate?,Acute hemolysis unrelated to liver disease,Primary bone‑marrow failure,Portal hypertension with hypersplenism,Autoimmune hepatitis,Acute Budd–Chiari syndrome,C,"**Portal hypertension (PH)** is common in long‑term survivors after Kasai. Clinical clues include **splenomegaly** and **thrombocytopenia** from hypersplenism; variceal bleeding and ascites are later manifestations. 

Development of significant PH and hypersplenism should prompt evaluation for **liver transplantation**, as this complication portends progressive hepatic disease despite initial bile drainage."
9,Biliary Atresia,An infant fails to show bilirubin improvement after Kasai. Which statement reflects current guidance regarding revision of the portoenterostomy?,Revision usually restores bile drainage and is routinely recommended,Revision is unlikely to improve long‑term outcomes and may complicate later transplant,Revision is required to maintain transplant eligibility,Revision eliminates risk of cholangitis,Revision is superior to early listing for transplant,B,"When **bilirubin fails to fall** after Kasai, **revision of the portoenterostomy rarely changes the trajectory** and may complicate a future transplant by increasing operative difficulty. Select scenarios exist (e.g., suspected anastomotic stricture in a child who previously cleared jaundice) where re‑exploration may help, but routine revision after primary failure is not supported. 

Accordingly, centers often prioritize **medical optimization and timely transplant evaluation** rather than repeat Kasai."
10,Biliary Atresia,Which associated anomalies suggest the biliary atresia–splenic malformation (BASM) spectrum?,Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and pyloric webs,"Left‑right laterality defects (e.g., polysplenia), malrotation, and cardiac defects",Hypospadias and posterior urethral valves,Cleft palate and craniosynostosis,Isolated Hirschsprung disease,B,"About **10%** of BA occurs with **laterality defects** as **BASM**, which includes **polysplenia**, **situs anomalies**, **malrotation**, and frequent **cardiac defects**. Another ~6% have syndromic associations without laterality anomalies, commonly cardiac, GU, or GI anomalies. 

Recognizing these patterns guides perioperative planning (e.g., cardiac workup, malrotation assessment) and counseling."
11,Biliary Atresia,Which clinical statement about stool color in biliary atresia is most accurate?,Acholic stools are sensitive but not specific for BA,Meconium is absent in BA,Acholic stools are specific but not sensitive for BA,Stool color is rarely altered in BA,Hemoccult‑positive stools are typical early in BA,C,"**Acholic (pale or clay‑colored) stools** are **specific but not sensitive** for BA. Some infants with BA will still pass yellow stools, and dark urine may make acholic stools harder to appreciate. 

Thus stool color contributes to suspicion but cannot be the sole screening tool; persistent jaundice beyond two weeks requires a full cholestasis evaluation."
12,Biliary Atresia,Which epidemiologic statement about biliary atresia is correct?,"It is common, occurring in ~1% of live births",It has a female predominance and is more common in non‑Caucasian populations,It is more common in Europe than in Asia,It is strongly inherited with high familial recurrence,Incidence is stable worldwide with no geographic variation,B,"BA is **rare** but the **most common cause of end‑stage liver disease in infants**. It demonstrates a **slight female predominance** and is more common in some non‑Caucasian populations; incidence varies geographically and temporally. 

Reported incidence ranges roughly from **1 in 20,000** to **3 in 10,000** live births depending on region. Familial inheritance is not typical; most cases are sporadic."
13,Biliary Atresia,Ohi/Superina anatomic classification of BA primarily categorizes disease based on:,Presence of intrahepatic biliary dysgenesis,Level of extrahepatic biliary obstruction/atresia,Histologic degree of portal fibrosis,Presence of associated cardiac anomalies,Variations in hepatic arterial anatomy,B,"Anatomic systems (e.g., **Ohi**, **Superina**) classify BA by the **level and extent of extrahepatic biliary obstruction/atresia** and its proximal/distal subtypes. 

These patterns correlate with technical details at Kasai and may have prognostic implications for early jaundice clearance and transplant‑free survival."
14,Biliary Atresia,Which laboratory approach is most appropriate at first presentation of an infant with suspected BA?,Order only a total bilirubin,"Order fractionated bilirubin, liver enzymes, and broader cholestasis labs",Delay labs until after ultrasound results,Obtain coagulation tests only if there is bruising,Focus on genetic testing first,B,"A cholestasis evaluation begins with **fractionated (direct) bilirubin**, **liver enzymes**, and complementary labs (coagulation profile, metabolic screens, infection workup). 

Because early diagnosis improves outcomes, it is critical to **start the lab workup immediately** rather than waiting for imaging."
15,Biliary Atresia,"When using HIDA in the workup for BA, which preparatory step is commonly recommended?",No preparation is necessary,Administer phenobarbital for several days before the scan,Keep the infant NPO for 48 hours,Give high‑dose vitamin K for 3 days,Hold all feeds for 24 hours,B,"**Phenobarbital priming** for several days can improve tracer excretion and interpretability of HIDA scans. Even with priming, HIDA remains an adjunct rather than a definitive test. 

Equivocal or nonexcretory HIDA should not delay **cholangiography** when BA is suspected."
16,Biliary Atresia,"Two weeks after Kasai, which clinical change best correlates with restoration of bile flow?",Normalization of AST/ALT,Pigmentation of stools,Normalization of INR,Resolution of hepatomegaly,Weight gain of >10%,B,"**Pigmented stools within the first two weeks** after Kasai are a practical bedside sign of biliary drainage and predict improved outcomes. 

Enzyme and synthetic function changes may lag; bilirubin trend and stool color are more immediately informative."
17,Biliary Atresia,Which finding should most strongly prompt evaluation for liver transplantation in a post‑Kasai patient?,Mildly elevated ALT with normal growth,Isolated gallbladder dyskinesia,Progressive portal hypertension with hypersplenism and variceal bleeding,Single episode of otitis media,Asymptomatic cholelithiasis,C,"**Progressive portal hypertension and its complications** (e.g., hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia, variceal bleeding, refractory ascites) indicate advancing liver disease and are key triggers for **transplant evaluation** in BA survivors. 

Native‑liver survival depends on sustained bile drainage and avoidance of progressive fibrosis; when those fail, timely transplantation improves outcomes."
18,Biliary Atresia,A long‑term BA survivor (native liver) presents with an upper‑extremity fracture after minor trauma. Which contributing factor is most plausible in this population?,Excess vitamin A supplementation,Vitamin D deficiency and bone fragility,Hyperparathyroidism,Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia,Osteogenesis imperfecta type I,B,"Children with BA—especially those with chronic cholestasis or reduced sunlight exposure—are at risk for **vitamin D deficiency and fractures**. Pre‑transplant fracture rates up to ~15% have been reported, with the **upper extremity commonly affected**. 

Attention to fat‑soluble vitamins and bone health is part of longitudinal care in BA patients."
19,Biliary Atresia,An infant initially achieves bilirubin normalization after Kasai but later shows a sudden bilirubin rise with pale stools and fever. Best next step?,Assume irreversible graft failure and list for transplant,Start broad‑spectrum antibiotics for possible cholangitis and reassess,Immediate revision of portoenterostomy in all cases,Stop feeds; begin TPN for 1 week,High‑dose corticosteroids for 14 days,B,"A **sudden rise in bilirubin** with fever and stool color change after initial clearance suggests **cholangitis** or, less commonly, a mechanical issue at the porta. First‑line management is **prompt antibiotics** and supportive care. 

If cholestasis persists despite appropriate therapy, further evaluation (including consideration of operative assessment) may be warranted, but blanket revision is not routinely beneficial."
20,Biliary Atresia,Which condition is most important to exclude early in the evaluation of an infant with cholestasis to avoid delaying BA diagnosis?,Choledochal cyst,Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,Midgut volvulus,Hirschsprung disease,Intussusception,A,"**Choledochal cyst** can present with cholestasis and biliary obstruction in infancy and is typically distinguishable on ultrasound by **ductal dilation**. Early identification matters because its management and urgency differ from BA. 

Systematically excluding structural and metabolic mimics—while **maintaining momentum toward cholangiography** when suspicion remains—is central to efficient BA workup."
21,Biliary Atresia,Which statement best captures the philosophy of the BA diagnostic algorithm?,Tests should be sequential over months to avoid unnecessary procedures,"Because most tests have limited accuracy in isolation, the evaluation should be parallel and expeditious",A normal ultrasound excludes BA,A single normal liver test excludes BA,Delay invasive testing until 6 months of age if the infant is growing,B,"No single preoperative test has perfect accuracy for BA. The evaluation should proceed **expeditiously** and often **in parallel**, assembling multiple data points while avoiding delays that could push surgery beyond the optimal window. 

The algorithm emphasizes **timeliness** over prolonged stepwise waiting."
22,Biliary Atresia,Parents ask about expected outcomes after Kasai. Which counseling point is most accurate?,Most infants will clear jaundice within 2 weeks and half of those will enjoy long‑term biliary drainage,Kasai invariably cures BA; transplant is no longer needed,Kasai rarely improves bile flow; transplant is required in nearly all by 6 months,"Even with delayed surgery (>120 days), outcomes are equivalent if the surgeon is experienced",Postoperative stool color is not informative,A,"After Kasai, **pigmented stools within 2 weeks** indicate restored drainage in many infants. Roughly **two‑thirds** experience initial bile flow, and **about half** of those maintain **long‑term drainage**. Nevertheless, a significant fraction will ultimately require transplantation. 

Setting realistic expectations helps families understand both the potential for native‑liver survival and the need for long‑term follow‑up."
23,Biliary Atresia,An infant with suspected BA has polysplenia and malrotation on ultrasound. What additional perioperative step is prudent?,Schedule splenectomy,Defer cardiac evaluation until after Kasai,Plan for evaluation/correction of malrotation and a thorough cardiac workup,Avoid Ladd procedure due to risk of bile leak,Convert to liver transplant emergently,C,"Findings suggest **BASM** with **laterality defects**. These infants frequently have **cardiac anomalies** and **malrotation**, both of which influence anesthetic risk and surgical planning. 

A comprehensive perioperative plan should include **cardiac evaluation** and consideration of **Ladd procedure** when malrotation is present."
24,Biliary Atresia,Which statement about global incidence is true?,Incidence is uniform worldwide,"Some regions (e.g., parts of the Pacific) report higher incidence than Western Europe","Incidence is >1 in 1,000 worldwide",BA incidence is decreasing everywhere due to vaccination,BA affects preterm infants exclusively,B,"BA shows **geographic variation**: some Pacific/Asian regions report higher incidence compared with Western Europe/North America. Reported values span from roughly **1 in 20,000** to **3 in 10,000** live births depending on locale. 

Prematurity is not required; many affected infants are term with normal birth weight."
25,Biliary Atresia,"During exploration for suspected BA, cholangiogram shows no patent extrahepatic ducts. What is the most appropriate next step?",Abort and obtain postoperative MRI,Proceed directly to Kasai portoenterostomy,Place a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain,Perform partial hepatectomy,Close and observe for 2 weeks,B,"When **operative cholangiogram confirms atresia**, the standard approach is to **proceed directly to Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy** in the same operation, assuming the patient is a candidate. 

Deferring treatment prolongs cholestasis and worsens outcomes."
26,Biliary Atresia,Which initial laboratory set is least helpful in the specific evaluation for BA?,Direct bilirubin and liver enzymes,Coagulation profile and basic metabolic panel,TORCH studies and α1‑antitrypsin level as indicated,Urinalysis and serum lipoprotein‑X when available,Serum amylase/lipase trend over 48 hours,E,"Early lab evaluation targets **cholestasis and synthetic function** and screens key metabolic/infectious causes (e.g., TORCH, α1‑antitrypsin). **Serum amylase/lipase** trends are not central to BA evaluation and would not meaningfully alter early management. 

Parallel labs paired with imaging keep the pathway moving toward a definitive diagnosis."
27,Biliary Atresia,A nonexcretory HIDA scan in a jaundiced infant most reliably indicates:,Biliary atresia is definitive,Severe cholestasis; BA cannot be confirmed without cholangiography,Normal biliary drainage,Pancreatic duct obstruction,Congenital hepatic fibrosis,B,"Nonexcretion on HIDA indicates **severe cholestasis** but is **not specific** for BA; other hepatocellular diseases can yield similar findings. Persisting clinical suspicion should lead to **cholangiography** for confirmation. 

Thus HIDA helps triage but does not obviate the need for definitive testing."
28,Biliary Atresia,Which concept best reflects native‑liver survival after Kasai?,"If jaundice clears early, many children can have years of transplant‑free survival",Native‑liver survival is unrelated to early bilirubin trends,Cleared jaundice usually relapses within 1 month in most patients,All children will need transplant by age 2 despite Kasai,Native‑liver survival depends only on center volume,A,"**Early clearance of jaundice** is associated with **better transplant‑free (native‑liver) survival**. While many children ultimately require transplant, a substantial subset with good early drainage achieve prolonged survival with their native liver. 

Center expertise matters, but patient factors and disease biology are also important determinants."
29,Biliary Atresia,Which practical bedside tool can help families and clinicians recognize concerning stool colors in early infancy?,Pain scales,Stool color cards for parental screening,Scoliosis screening cards,BMI growth nomograms,Apgar charts,B,"Public health programs in some regions use **stool color cards** to help parents identify **acholic stools** and prompt earlier medical evaluation for cholestasis/BA. Earlier recognition supports earlier referral and surgery, improving outcomes. 

While not universally implemented, such screening reflects the importance of stool color in early detection."
30,Biliary Atresia,A 6‑week‑old has direct hyperbilirubinemia and ultrasound without ductal dilation. HIDA is nonexcretory after phenobarbital. What is the most appropriate next step?,Defer further testing until 3 months if the infant is thriving,Start ursodeoxycholic acid and recheck bilirubin in 4 weeks,Proceed to cholangiography to definitively evaluate for BA,Assume neonatal hepatitis and observe,Obtain abdominal CT with contrast,C,"Given persistent cholestasis, supportive imaging, and **nonexcretory HIDA** after priming, the next step is **cholangiography** to establish or exclude BA definitively. 

Delaying invasive evaluation risks missing the optimal surgical window and adversely affects outcomes."
