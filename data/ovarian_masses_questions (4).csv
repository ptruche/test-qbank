"1","ovarian_masses","A 14-year-old postmenarchal girl presents with 12 hours of right lower quadrant pain and nausea. She is afebrile; WBC 8.5; beta-hCG negative. Pelvic ultrasound shows an enlarged right ovary (5.2 cm) with heterogeneous echotexture and peripheral follicles; arterial/venous Doppler signals are equivocal. What is the next best step in management?","Observe with NSAIDs and repeat ultrasound in 24–48 hours","Immediate diagnostic laparoscopy with detorsion if torsion is identified","CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for appendicitis","Start combined oral contraceptives to suppress functional cysts","Schedule elective oophorectomy in 1–2 weeks","B","Correct answer: B — Immediate diagnostic laparoscopy with detorsion if torsion is identified.
Rationale: Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive clinical diagnosis. Ultrasound with Doppler is helpful but not definitive: normal flow does not exclude torsion due to dual arterial supply and intermittent torsion–detorsion. In an adolescent with acute pain and an enlarged echogenic ovary, prompt laparoscopy is indicated to salvage ovarian function. Operative priorities are detorsion, assessment for mass or hemorrhage, peritoneal washings if a tumor is suspected, and careful inspection of the peritoneal surfaces/omentum/diaphragm for implants if a neoplasm is present. Ovarian preservation is the rule—even a dusky, edematous ovary can recover. If a benign-appearing cyst is present, perform cystectomy or defer resection until tissue planes improve; avoid blind oophorectomy.
Incorrect options: Observation (A) risks ischemic loss. CT for appendicitis (C) adds radiation and delays definitive management of a gynecologic emergency. OCPs (D) neither treat torsion nor prevent it. Elective oophorectomy (E) is overtreatment and violates fertility-preserving principles.
Key point: Equivocal Doppler does not rule out torsion; clinical judgment favors urgent laparoscopy to preserve the ovary."
"2","ovarian_masses","A 13-year-old with a 7-cm complex adnexal mass is scheduled for surgery. Which laboratory panel is most appropriate to obtain preoperatively if feasible?","CBC and CMP only","AFP, beta-hCG, and CA-125 (± CA 19-9 if mucinous tumor suspected)","LDH and ESR","Estradiol and progesterone levels","No laboratory tests are required since malignancy is rare","B","Correct answer: B — AFP, beta-hCG, and CA-125 (consider CA 19-9 if mucinous tumor suspected).
Rationale: Tumor markers inform intraoperative decisions (extent of resection, spill avoidance) and guide surveillance. AFP suggests yolk sac elements; beta-hCG suggests choriocarcinoma/mixed GCT; CA-125 can be elevated in epithelial malignancy and occasionally GCT; CA 19-9 may rise with mucinous epithelial tumors. Draw markers before anesthesia if possible but do not delay urgent exploration for results.
Incorrect options: CBC/CMP (A) omit disease-defining markers. LDH/ESR (C) lack specificity. Sex steroids (D) are not useful for a solid/complex mass differential. Skipping markers (E) forfeits crucial baseline data that shape staging and follow-up.
Pearl: Marker elevation (AFP or hCG) generally shifts strategy toward salpingo-oophorectomy with staging rather than ovarian-sparing surgery."
"3","ovarian_masses","During laparoscopy for a suspected ovarian germ cell tumor in a 12-year-old, which steps constitute appropriate pediatric staging?","Peritoneal washings; thorough inspection of peritoneal surfaces, omentum, diaphragm, and liver; biopsy/resection of suspicious lesions; inspect contralateral ovary","Systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in all cases","Mandatory omentectomy and pelvic nodal sampling regardless of findings","Frozen section biopsy of the contralateral ovary even if normal","Peritoneal washings only","A","Correct answer: A — Washings, comprehensive inspection, targeted biopsies, and contralateral inspection.
Rationale: COG-style pediatric germ cell staging emphasizes washings and visual survey of the entire peritoneal cavity, omentum, and upper abdomen with biopsy or removal of any suspicious lesions. Routine lymphadenectomy or omentectomy is not required for all pediatric GCTs. The contralateral ovary should be carefully inspected but not biopsied unless abnormal.
Incorrect options: Routine lymphadenectomy (B) and mandatory omentectomy/nodal sampling (C) reflect adult epithelial cancer practice (FIGO), not pediatric GCT. Frozen section of a normal opposite ovary (D) jeopardizes fertility without benefit. Washings alone (E) are inadequate.
Practice tip: Use a retrieval bag and avoid tumor spill if malignancy is suspected."
"4","ovarian_masses","A 14-year-old has persistent pelvic pain 4 weeks after detorsion with no discrete mass intraoperatively. Ultrasound shows an enlarged ovary without clear lesion. What is the best next study?","Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen/pelvis","MRI pelvis with and without fat-suppressed sequences","Nuclear medicine bone scan","Repeat ultrasound immediately","Proceed to oophorectomy for definitive therapy","B","Correct answer: B — MRI pelvis with and without fat-suppressed sequences.
Rationale: MRI offers superior soft-tissue characterization and can differentiate hemorrhagic/resolving functional changes from neoplasm. Fat suppression identifies macroscopic fat highly suggestive of mature cystic teratoma. MRI also delineates planes to assess feasibility of ovarian-sparing enucleation.
Incorrect options: CT (A) adds radiation without better tissue characterization. Immediate repeat US (D) is low yield after multiple equivocal studies. Bone scan (C) is irrelevant. Oophorectomy (E) contradicts ovarian-preserving principles in the absence of malignancy.
Pearl: MRI confirmation of a small fat-containing lesion supports planned ovarian-sparing resection via controlled approach."
"5","ovarian_masses","A 15-year-old with MRI-proven 3.6-cm right ovarian dermoid, normal AFP/beta-hCG. Preferred operative strategy?","Laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy to avoid rupture","Pfannenstiel minilaparotomy (or contained laparoscopy) with ovarian-sparing enucleation","Midline laparotomy and hysterectomy","Expectant management only","Cyst aspiration and cauterization of the cavity","B","Correct answer: B — Ovarian-sparing enucleation via Pfannenstiel minilaparotomy or contained laparoscopy.
Rationale: For benign dermoids, the standard is ovarian preservation with careful enucleation and spill minimization (use a retrieval bag; consider extracorporeal cystotomy within the bag if needed). Small transverse incision provides tactile control; laparoscopy is acceptable if containment is ensured.
Incorrect options: Oophorectomy (A) sacrifices fertility unnecessarily. Hysterectomy (C) is inappropriate. Observation alone (D) risks growth/torsion. Aspiration (E) leads to recurrence and chemical peritonitis.
Technical tip: Dissect along the capsular plane and reconstruct the ovarian remnant to preserve function."
"6","ovarian_masses","Pathology handling of a 4-cm ovarian teratoma from a 12-year-old should include which approach?","One representative section of the cyst wall is sufficient","Sample at least one section per centimeter of maximal diameter to assess for immature/malignant elements","Sample only calcified or hairy areas","No histology is required for small dermoids","Frozen section alone is sufficient","B","Correct answer: B — ≥1 section per centimeter of tumor.
Rationale: Teratomas are heterogeneous; malignant or immature components may be focal. Generous sampling prevents understaging. Pediatric immature teratomas (stage I) may be managed with surgery alone, but detection of yolk sac elements (AFP-elevating) changes management.
Incorrect options: Limited sampling (A,C) risks missing key elements. Skipping histology (D) is unsafe. Frozen section alone (E) lacks reliability for final grading.
Clinical impact: Pathology guides surveillance and the need for adjuvant therapy."
"7","ovarian_masses","After ovarian-sparing resection of a mature cystic teratoma with normal markers, which follow-up is most appropriate?","No follow-up after complete excision","Annual pelvic ultrasound (after a 6-month check) and counseling regarding contralateral metachronous risk","Quarterly AFP and beta-hCG for 5 years","Adjuvant chemotherapy due to recurrence risk","Prophylactic contralateral oophorectomy","B","Correct answer: B — Ultrasound surveillance and counseling.
Rationale: Ipsilateral recurrence is uncommon, but metachronous contralateral dermoids occur (roughly 10–20% long term). Routine markers are unhelpful if baseline normal. Ultrasound at ~6 months and then annually is reasonable.
Incorrect options: No follow-up (A) misses contralateral disease. Marker surveillance (C) is not informative. Chemotherapy (D) is not indicated for benign lesions. Prophylactic oophorectomy (E) is harmful and unnecessary.
Counseling: Educate on torsion symptoms and the plan for future pregnancy/fertility."
"8","ovarian_masses","A 15-year-old with recurrent functional cysts asks whether combined oral contraceptives will prevent new cysts. Best evidence-based counsel?","OCPs clearly prevent functional cysts; start therapy","OCPs have not shown reduction in incidence and should not be used solely for cyst prevention","OCPs increase torsion risk","OCPs are contraindicated after dermoid cystectomy","OCPs prevent contralateral metachronous dermoids","B","Correct answer: B — OCPs are not proven to prevent functional cysts.
Rationale: Data do not support OCPs as prophylaxis for functional cyst formation in adolescents. They can be prescribed for contraception or dysmenorrhea but not solely to prevent cysts or torsion.
Incorrect options: Claims in (A,C,D,E) are unsupported.
Takeaway: Observation and interval imaging are appropriate for simple asymptomatic cysts; intervene if persistent/enlarging/symptomatic."
"9","ovarian_masses","A 15-year-old with ovarian mass rupture intraoperatively is found to have multiple peritoneal glial nodules; markers are normal; final pathology: immature teratoma without malignant germ cell elements. Which statement is most accurate?","Peritoneal glial implants represent metastasis and upstage the tumor","Glial implants (gliomatosis peritonei) are benign/metaplastic and do not upstage","All immature teratomas require adjuvant chemotherapy","Spillage invariably worsens pediatric outcomes","Contralateral oophorectomy is recommended","B","Correct answer: B — Gliomatosis peritonei is benign and does not upstage.
Rationale: Glial implants after dermoid rupture represent benign metaplasia rather than metastasis. In pediatric series, stage I immature teratomas—even high grade—are often treated with surgery alone; chemotherapy is reserved for malignant elements or advanced stage. Minimize spill, but pediatric outcomes are not clearly worsened by isolated spillage.
Incorrect options: (A) misinterprets biology; (C) over-treats; (D) overstates spill impact; (E) is harmful.
Management: Surveillance with imaging and clinical follow-up; address symptoms if chemical peritonitis develops."
"10","ovarian_masses","A 13-year-old has an ovarian mass with imaging suggestive of teratoma; AFP is 145 ng/mL (elevated), beta-hCG normal. No extra-ovarian disease on imaging. Optimal operative plan?","Ovarian-sparing enucleation","Salpingo-oophorectomy with careful staging and spill avoidance","Percutaneous aspiration for decompression before surgery","Biopsy now, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, then resection","Laparoscopic cyst unroofing","B","Correct answer: B — Salpingo-oophorectomy with staging.
Rationale: Elevated AFP suggests yolk sac tumor elements (malignant teratoma). Ovarian-sparing surgery risks residual malignancy and spill. Perform salpingo-oophorectomy with washings, comprehensive inspection, targeted biopsies, and retrieval bag extraction.
Incorrect options: Enucleation/unroofing (A,E) are inappropriate oncologically. Aspiration (C) risks seeding. Biopsy-first (D) is unnecessary and increases spill risk.
Postoperative plan: AFP kinetics guide surveillance; adjuvant therapy reserved for residual/advanced disease."
"11","ovarian_masses","A phenotypic 12-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea and a solid ovarian mass has karyotype 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Which tumor type is classically associated?","Dysgerminoma","Yolk sac tumor","Mucinous cystadenoma","Granulosa cell tumor","Thecoma","A","Correct answer: A — Dysgerminoma.
Rationale: Dysgerminoma, the ovarian counterpart of seminoma, is linked to dysgenetic gonads and may present with LDH elevation; AFP/hCG are typically normal unless mixed. Management involves unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with staging. Consider endocrinology/genetics for gonadal dysgenesis.
Incorrect options: Yolk sac tumor (B) elevates AFP; mucinous epithelial tumor (C) is unrelated to dysgenesis; granulosa (D) and thecoma (E) are sex cord–stromal with estrogenic effects, not typically associated with 46,XY.
Fertility/endocrine issues deserve multidisciplinary planning."
"12","ovarian_masses","A 17-year-old has a large multiloculated ovarian cyst with thick septations; CA 19-9 is elevated; AFP/hCG/CA-125 are normal. Which staging principle applies if an epithelial mucinous tumor is suspected?","FIGO staging (omentectomy, peritoneal biopsies, nodal sampling) is often applied, though pediatric evidence is limited","COG germ cell staging applies","No staging if CA-125 is normal","Routine bilateral oophorectomy is recommended","Sentinel lymph node biopsy is mandatory","A","Correct answer: A — Apply FIGO-style staging when epithelial malignancy is suspected, acknowledging limited pediatric data.
Rationale: Adolescents with suspected epithelial tumors are frequently staged per FIGO principles (washings, omentectomy, peritoneal biopsies ± nodal sampling) when malignancy is a concern. Individualize to preserve fertility when safe.
Incorrect options: COG staging (B) is for GCT. Normal CA-125 (C) does not exclude malignancy. Bilateral oophorectomy (D) is not standard. Sentinel mapping (E) is not established.
Key point: Tailor staging to intraoperative findings and final pathology."
"13","ovarian_masses","An 8-year-old girl presents with vaginal bleeding and a large complex ovarian mass. Which marker and behavior are most characteristic?","Inhibin; juvenile granulosa cell tumors may recur early and can be aggressive","CA 19-9; benign course is typical","AFP; chemotherapy is never indicated","LDH; dysgerminoma is expected","beta-hCG; choriocarcinoma predominates","A","Correct answer: A — Inhibin; juvenile granulosa cell tumor behavior can be aggressive with early recurrence.
Rationale: Granulosa-stromal tumors often present with isosexual pseudoprecocity. Inhibin is a useful marker. Complete resection with staging is primary treatment; adjuvant platinum-based therapy considered for advanced/ruptured disease.
Incorrect options: CA 19-9 (B) aligns with mucinous epithelial tumors; AFP (C) is for yolk sac; LDH (D) relates to dysgerminoma; hCG (E) suggests choriocarcinoma.
Clinical: Evaluate endometrial effects of estrogen exposure."
"14","ovarian_masses","A 9-year-old has ovarian torsion with a cystic teratoma; the ovary is hemorrhagic and planes are indistinct. Best ovarian-preserving approach?","Complete oophorectomy","Hilar wedge resection if classic enucleation planes are obliterated","Blind cyst aspiration","Second-look surgery in 48 hours","Hysterectomy","B","Correct answer: B — Hilar wedge resection to preserve viable parenchyma.
Rationale: After detorsion, if edema obscures planes, a limited wedge resection may remove the lesion while preserving tissue. Many reperfused ovaries recover. Final pathology and markers dictate further care.
Incorrect options: Oophorectomy (A) is often avoidable; aspiration (C) risks spill; planned second look (D) is unnecessary; hysterectomy (E) is never indicated.
Follow-up: Ultrasound demonstrates recovery of ovarian volume/function over months."
"15","ovarian_masses","Stage I malignant teratoma resected with salpingo-oophorectomy in a 13-year-old; AFP normalizes post-op. Optimal surveillance?","No surveillance after normalization","Quarterly AFP levels with exam/imaging as indicated; recurrences are salvageable with platinum-based chemotherapy","Immediate adjuvant chemotherapy for all stage I cases","Annual CA-125 levels only","Monthly PET/CT scans for two years","B","Correct answer: B — Marker-based surveillance.
Rationale: Many pediatric stage I malignant teratomas are managed with surgery alone plus close AFP surveillance. Rising AFP heralds recurrence; early detection allows effective salvage (e.g., carboplatin/etoposide/bleomycin). Routine chemotherapy for all (C) over-treats.
Incorrect options: Skipping follow-up (A) risks delayed detection. CA-125 (D) is not relevant. PET/CT (E) adds radiation without proven benefit.
Plan: Define a schedule (e.g., every 3 months for year 1–2, then spacing out) with symptom-driven imaging."
"16","ovarian_masses","A 12-year-old with an incidental 4.5-cm simple ovarian cyst is asymptomatic; pregnancy test negative. Best management?","Immediate cystectomy","Expectant management with repeat ultrasound in 6–8 weeks","Start chemotherapy","CT to better characterize","Percutaneous aspiration under ultrasound guidance","B","Correct answer: B — Observation with interval ultrasound.
Rationale: Simple cysts <5–6 cm in asymptomatic adolescents are usually functional and resolve. Operate if persistent, enlarging, symptomatic, or complex.
Incorrect options: Surgery (A) is unnecessary; chemotherapy (C) irrelevant; CT (D) adds radiation without benefit; aspiration (E) has high recurrence and spill risk.
Algorithm: Negative pregnancy test, simple cyst, asymptomatic → observe."
"17","ovarian_masses","Which MRI feature is most characteristic of mature cystic teratoma (dermoid)?","Restricted diffusion within solid components","Uniform T2 hypointensity","Macroscopic fat with signal dropout on fat-suppressed sequences","Peripheral nodular enhancement","Marked ascites with peritoneal thickening","C","Correct answer: C — Macroscopic fat with fat-suppressed signal dropout.
Rationale: Dermoids contain macroscopic fat, hair, sebaceous material; MRI fat suppression confirms diagnosis. US may show echogenic foci with shadowing; CT shows fat and calcifications.
Incorrect options: Restricted diffusion (A) is nonspecific; T2 hypointensity (B) atypical; peripheral nodular enhancement (D) suggests hemangioma; ascites with peritoneal thickening (E) suggests malignancy.
Imaging pearl: Look for Rokitansky nodule and fat–fluid levels."
"18","ovarian_masses","During laparoscopic dermoid cystectomy, which technique best minimizes intraperitoneal spill?","Freehand cyst aspiration within the peritoneal cavity","Use of an endoscopic retrieval bag with controlled extracorporeal cystotomy if decompression needed","Allow cyst to desiccate in situ","Sharp curettage of the cyst wall","No special measures are necessary","B","Correct answer: B — Retrieval bag and controlled decompression.
Rationale: Containment prevents chemical peritonitis and glial seeding. If needed, decompress inside the bag, then extract. Copious irrigation for any spill.
Incorrect options: Intra-abdominal aspiration (A) risks spill; desiccation (C) and curettage (D) are inappropriate; dismissing spill (E) is unsafe practice.
Tip: Have large bags available and plan the extraction route before capsulotomy."
"19","ovarian_masses","A 16-year-old with a massive multiloculated ovarian cyst has elevated CA 19-9, normal AFP/beta-hCG/CA-125. Most likely tumor type?","Mucinous epithelial tumor (benign or borderline spectrum)","Dysgerminoma","Granulosa cell tumor","Yolk sac tumor","Thecoma","A","Correct answer: A — Mucinous epithelial tumor.
Rationale: CA 19-9 elevation with a giant multiloculated cyst favors mucinous pathology. Management includes controlled aspiration and containment to facilitate removal, followed by histologic classification (benign vs borderline vs carcinoma) to guide staging and surveillance.
Incorrect options: Dysgerminoma (B) may raise LDH; granulosa (C) is inhibin-positive; yolk sac (D) elevates AFP; thecoma (E) is hormonally active.
Follow-up: Track CA 19-9 trends only if elevated pre-op and correlate with imaging."
"20","ovarian_masses","Postoperative counseling after ovarian-sparing dermoid cystectomy should include which statement?","Future fertility is typically preserved with a substantial ovarian remnant","All patients require chemotherapy","Pregnancy is contraindicated for 5 years","Contralateral oophorectomy reduces recurrence risk","Oral contraceptives prevent recurrence","A","Correct answer: A — Fertility generally preserved.
Rationale: Preservation of normal parenchyma maintains endocrine function and fertility potential. Recurrence risk ipsilaterally is low; contralateral metachronous tumors occur in a minority; surveillance is appropriate.
Incorrect options: Chemotherapy (B) is not indicated; pregnancy restriction (C) is unnecessary; contralateral oophorectomy (D) is harmful; OCPs (E) do not prevent recurrence.
Counseling: Educate on symptoms of torsion and schedule periodic imaging."
"21","ovarian_masses","A 13-year-old has a 5.5-cm complex cyst with septations 2 weeks after menses; markers normal. Which is most accurate?","Hemorrhagic functional cyst cannot always be distinguished from neoplasm on ultrasound; MRI helps","Normal markers exclude malignancy","Immediate oophorectomy is indicated","Aspiration will confirm diagnosis and prevent recurrence","CA-125 level should decide between surgery and observation","A","Correct answer: A — MRI clarifies equivocal ultrasound in distinguishing hemorrhagic cysts from neoplasms.
Rationale: Sonographic overlap exists; MRI refines characterization and informs timing of surgery vs observation. Normal markers reduce but do not eliminate risk.
Incorrect options: Oophorectomy (C) is excessive; aspiration (D) risks spill/recurrence; CA-125 (E) lacks specificity in adolescents.
Plan: If MRI favors hemorrhagic cyst and symptoms are mild, observe with repeat imaging."
"22","ovarian_masses","During laparoscopy for suspected torsion, detorsion restores color; no discrete mass is seen. Best management now?","Terminate the procedure and follow with serial imaging; avoid blind resection","Wedge resection to reduce ovarian size","Oophorectomy to prevent recurrence","Blind cyst unroofing","Convert to laparotomy for exploration","A","Correct answer: A — Conservative management after detorsion without a mass.
Rationale: The ovary often recovers; blind resection sacrifices tissue unnecessarily. Postoperative imaging monitors resolution and identifies lesions that declare themselves as edema subsides.
Incorrect options: Wedge resection (B) or unroofing (D) without a lesion is inappropriate; oophorectomy (C) harms fertility; conversion (E) adds morbidity without benefit.
Follow-up: Ultrasound at 6–8 weeks to document recovery."
"23","ovarian_masses","A 13-year-old with prior stage I malignant teratoma now presents with recurrent peritoneal disease and AFP 2,000 ng/mL. Preferred systemic therapy?","Carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEB)","Doxorubicin and ifosfamide","Methotrexate and vinblastine","Cyclophosphamide and topotecan","Imatinib","A","Correct answer: A — Platinum-based PEB regimen.
Rationale: Pediatric malignant ovarian germ cell tumors respond to platinum-based chemotherapy; PEB is a standard salvage regimen. Treatment is coordinated with pediatric oncology; AFP kinetics track response.
Incorrect options: The other regimens are not standard for ovarian GCT.
Care: Address fertility preservation counseling before therapy when feasible."
"24","ovarian_masses","Pathology from a large mucinous tumor in a 15-year-old shows epithelial proliferation with stratification and filiform papillae but no stromal invasion (>10% of tumor). Best diagnosis?","Benign mucinous cystadenoma","Borderline mucinous tumor","Invasive mucinous carcinoma","Immature teratoma","Granulosa cell tumor","B","Correct answer: B — Borderline mucinous tumor.
Rationale: Borderline tumors exhibit epithelial proliferation and atypia without stromal invasion. Management is complete resection with consideration of FIGO-style staging if malignancy suspected, and surveillance thereafter.
Incorrect options: Benign cystadenoma (A) lacks proliferation; invasive carcinoma (C) has stromal invasion; immature teratoma (D) is a germ cell tumor; granulosa (E) is sex cord–stromal and inhibin-positive.
Follow-up: Periodic imaging; marker trends (CA 19-9) only if elevated pre-op."
"25","ovarian_masses","In pediatric ovarian germ cell tumors, what is the recommended approach to lymph nodes?","Systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in all patients","Sample or remove only clinically/radiographically suspicious nodes","Skip nodal assessment entirely","Perform sentinel lymph node mapping","Fine needle aspirate all pelvic nodes","B","Correct answer: B — Target suspicious nodes only.
Rationale: Pediatric staging emphasizes targeted assessment to limit morbidity; chemotherapy treats microscopic nodal disease effectively when present. Routine lymphadenectomy offers little benefit.
Incorrect options: Systematic dissection (A) reflects adult epithelial practice; skipping nodes (C) risks understaging; sentinel mapping (D) and blanket FNAs (E) are not standard.
Pearl: Thorough inspection remains essential; biopsy what is abnormal."
"26","ovarian_masses","Which scenario most strongly supports ovarian-sparing resection over salpingo-oophorectomy?","Classic dermoid with normal AFP/beta-hCG and no extra-ovarian disease","Solid mass with markedly elevated AFP","Mixed solid-cystic mass with high beta-hCG","Ruptured mass with glial implants and elevated AFP","Gross peritoneal implants on inspection","A","Correct answer: A — Benign-appearing dermoid with normal markers.
Rationale: Normal germ cell markers and classic imaging favor benign teratoma, for which preservation is standard. Marker elevation (B,C,D) or implants (E) suggest malignancy and favor oophorectomy with staging.
Decision rule: Benign imaging + normal markers → preserve; malignant features → oncologic resection."
"27","ovarian_masses","A 15-year-old with a giant mucinous ovarian cyst has tachypnea from mass effect. Which intraoperative strategy best facilitates safe removal?","Uncontrolled intra-abdominal puncture to decompress","Controlled aspiration with containment measures, then extraction","Percutaneous drainage days before surgery","Immediate hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy","Leave the tumor and give neoadjuvant chemotherapy","B","Correct answer: B — Controlled aspiration with containment.
Rationale: For giant mucinous tumors, controlled drainage (purse-string, suction, isolation) reduces volume and enables safe extraction while minimizing spillage/chemical peritonitis. Final pathology dictates staging and follow-up.
Incorrect options: Uncontrolled puncture (A) risks peritoneal contamination; pre-op drainage (C) is discouraged; hysterectomy (D) is excessive; neoadjuvant chemotherapy (E) lacks indication without proven malignancy.
Technique: Prepare suction traps and large retrieval bags; protect incision."
"28","ovarian_masses","Two weeks after dermoid cystectomy complicated by intraperitoneal spillage, a 16-year-old has abdominal pain and low-grade fevers. CT shows small-volume ascites with fat–fluid levels. Most likely diagnosis?","Bacterial peritonitis","Chemical peritonitis from sebaceous material","Pulmonary embolism","Bowel injury","Ovarian vein thrombosis","B","Correct answer: B — Chemical peritonitis due to dermoid contents.
Rationale: Spilled sebaceous material incites sterile inflammation; imaging may show fat–fluid levels. Management ranges from supportive care/NSAIDs to laparoscopic lavage if persistent.
Incorrect options: Bacterial peritonitis (A) typically has higher fevers and positive cultures; the other options (C–E) do not fit the imaging pattern.
Prevention: Strict containment, irrigation, and bag extraction."
"29","ovarian_masses","Which distribution best reflects the relative frequencies of ovarian tumor categories in children/adolescents?","Epithelial majority; germ cell minority; sex cord–stromal rare","Germ cell majority (~75–80%); epithelial ~15%; sex cord–stromal ~5%","Equal distribution among all three","Sex cord–stromal majority","Epithelial 50%, germ cell 40%, sex cord–stromal 10%","B","Correct answer: B — Germ cell tumors predominate in pediatrics.
Rationale: Unlike adults, pediatric ovarian neoplasms are mostly germ cell, with epithelial and sex cord–stromal less common. This epidemiology underlies the emphasis on germ cell markers and fertility-preserving surgery.
Incorrect options: The other distributions reflect adult patterns or are inaccurate.
Implication: Start with AFP/hCG ± CA-125/CA 19-9 based on imaging phenotype."
"30","ovarian_masses","Oral boards scenario: A 14-year-old with acute pelvic pain has an enlarged ovary and normal arterial Doppler flow on ultrasound. Best course and justification?","Reassure and discharge; normal Doppler excludes torsion","Admit and observe; repeat ultrasound tomorrow","Proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy because Doppler does not exclude torsion","Obtain MRI to better assess perfusion","Start anticoagulation for ovarian vein thrombosis","C","Correct answer: C — Diagnostic laparoscopy despite normal Doppler.
Rationale: Dual ovarian blood supply and intermittent torsion-detorsion produce false-negative Doppler exams. Given high clinical suspicion and organ salvage priorities, prompt laparoscopy is justified. Intraoperatively: detorse; avoid oophorectomy for color alone; perform washings if mass suspected; inspect peritoneal surfaces/omentum/diaphragm; preserve ovary when feasible.
Incorrect options: Discharge (A) or delay (B) risks organ loss; MRI (D) is unnecessary acutely; anticoagulation (E) is not indicated without thrombosis.
Exam tip: Use structured justification emphasizing time-sensitivity, diagnostic limits of Doppler, and fertility preservation."
