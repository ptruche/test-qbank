"1","Ovarian masses","Question: A 12-year-old premenarchal girl presents with 12 hours of sudden, severe right lower quadrant pain with nausea. Ultrasound shows an enlarged right ovary with peripheral follicles and absent venous flow, arterial flow equivocal; pregnancy test negative; tumor markers (AFP, β-hCG, LDH) pending. In the OR, the ovary appears dark, enlarged, and edematous with two twists of the utero-ovarian ligament. What is the most appropriate intraoperative decision?","Detorse the ovary and preserve it; avoid oophorectomy even if necrotic in appearance","Perform right oophorectomy due to concern for nonviable tissue","Biopsy the ovary before detorsion to exclude malignancy","Abort the procedure and await tumor marker results before intervention","","A","Correct Answer: A — Detorse the ovary and preserve it; avoid oophorectomy even if necrotic in appearance

Rationale and evidence: Pediatric ovarian torsion is most often associated with benign functional or cystic pathology; malignancy is rare (<2%). The ovary’s macroscopic color poorly predicts viability. Detorsion with ovarian preservation is the recommended first-line approach in children, with high rates of functional recovery on follow-up ultrasound despite alarming intraoperative appearance. Oophorectomy based on color alone risks unnecessary loss of future fertility and hormonal function.

Why the others are wrong:
• B: Oophorectomy should be avoided unless there is a clear non-salvageable rupture with uncontrolled bleeding or an obvious malignant tumor requiring oncologic resection. Most “black-blue” ovaries reperfuse and recover function after detorsion.  
• C: Biopsy risks bleeding and further compromises the parenchyma; it is not required when typical torsion is present. If a suspicious solid mass is identified, perform oncologic resection or staged evaluation—not random biopsy of a torsed edematous ovary.  
• D: Torsion is a surgical emergency; waiting for markers delays reperfusion and increases ischemic time.

Technique pearls (intraoperative):  
1) Gently untwist until the pedicle is straightened. 2) Avoid drilling/cautery of the cortex in children. 3) If a large simple cyst is present, decompress with controlled aspiration through a port or mini-incision, preferably in an endobag to reduce spillage. 4) Assess contralateral ovary. 5) Consider oophoropexy selectively (eg, recurrent torsion, long utero-ovarian ligament, Müllerian anomalies, solitary ovary). Typical first-time unilateral torsion without predisposing factors does not mandate routine oophoropexy.

Complications and follow-up: Early mobilization and analgesia; ultrasound at 4–6 weeks to document follicular activity. Educate family regarding recurrence symptoms.

Guidelines/consensus: Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology and APSA statements endorse ovarian preservation with detorsion and discourage oophorectomy based on appearance alone; malignancy in torsion is uncommon and detorsion does not increase thromboembolic events.

Table: Indications for Oophoropexy (selected)
| Indication | Example context |
|---|---|
| Recurrent torsion | Documented prior torsion (same or contralateral) |
| Solitary ovary | Prior oophorectomy or streak gonad |
| Müllerian anomalies | Absent uterus/long utero-ovarian ligament |
| Intraoperative finding of hypermobile ovary | Markedly elongated ligaments |

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Detorse and preserve—appearance is unreliable.  
• Malignancy in torsion is rare in children; do not delay for markers.  
• Selective, not routine, oophoropexy after first unilateral torsion.  
• Expect functional recovery on ultrasound in most cases.

"2","Ovarian masses","Question: A 10-year-old girl has a 10-cm unilateral solid ovarian mass with calcifications on ultrasound. She is afebrile, not torsed. Tumor markers: AFP normal, β-hCG normal, LDH mildly elevated. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Mature cystic teratoma (dermoid)","Dysgerminoma","Yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumor","Choriocarcinoma","","A","Correct Answer: A — Mature cystic teratoma (dermoid)

Reasoning: Dermoids are the most common pediatric ovarian neoplasm and often contain fat, hair, and calcified elements (eg, teeth), producing echogenic nodules with shadowing on ultrasound and fat-fluid levels on CT/MRI. Tumor markers are usually normal, though nonspecific LDH elevations can occur. The imaging hallmark is macroscopic fat or calcifications.

Why others are wrong:  
• B (Dysgerminoma): Often elevates LDH and may have normal AFP and β-hCG; however, calcifications and macroscopic fat suggest teratomatous elements rather than a pure dysgerminoma. Dysgerminomas are typically solid, homogeneous, lobulated masses without fat.  
• C (Yolk sac tumor): Characteristically elevates AFP substantially; imaging is solid and vascular without fat or teeth.  
• D (Choriocarcinoma): Elevates β-hCG markedly; rare as a primary in children.

Diagnostic algorithm: first-line ultrasound, then MRI for characterization if needed. Obtain tumor markers (AFP, β-hCG, LDH, CA-125, inhibin A/B, estradiol, testosterone) tailored to age and phenotype. For likely dermoids, plan cystectomy with ovarian preservation; avoid rupture to reduce chemical peritonitis and recurrence risk (use endobag, copious irrigation if spillage).

Table: Tumor marker patterns (classic, not absolute)
| Tumor type | AFP | β-hCG | LDH | Inhibin | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mature teratoma | N | N | ± | N | Fat/calcifications |
| Dysgerminoma | N | N | ↑ | N | Solid; may have streak gonads |
| Yolk sac | ↑↑ | N | N | N | Rapid growth, hemorrhagic |
| Choriocarcinoma | N | ↑↑ | N | N | Rare primary ovarian |
| Granulosa cell (juvenile) | N | N | N | ↑ inhibin | Estrogenic signs |

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Fat or calcifications on imaging → think dermoid.  
• Marker panel helps but imaging features drive differential.  
• Fertility-sparing cystectomy is standard for benign dermoid.  
• Use an endobag and minimize spillage.

"3","Ovarian masses","Question: A 14-year-old presents with a 16-cm predominantly solid left ovarian mass with ascites on ultrasound and MRI. Tumor markers: AFP markedly elevated; β-hCG normal; LDH normal. No torsion. What is the next best step in management?","Midline laparotomy with fertility-sparing oncologic staging and salpingo-oophorectomy","Laparoscopic cystectomy to avoid a large incision","Image-guided percutaneous biopsy before definitive surgery","Observation with repeat imaging in 6 weeks","","A","Correct Answer: A — Midline laparotomy with fertility-sparing oncologic staging and salpingo-oophorectomy

Clinical reasoning: A large, predominantly solid mass with ascites and significantly elevated AFP is highly suspicious for a malignant germ cell tumor (eg, yolk sac tumor). The appropriate next step is definitive oncologic resection via midline laparotomy to prevent rupture, enable safe vascular control, and perform complete staging. Fertility-sparing principles apply: remove the affected ovary/tube, preserve the uterus and contralateral ovary, and avoid tumor spill.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Laparoscopic cystectomy risks rupture and incomplete staging in a suspected malignancy; laparoscopy may be considered in highly selected cases, but standard pediatric oncologic practice favors laparotomy for large, solid, marker-positive tumors.  
• C: Percutaneous biopsy risks tumor seeding and is unnecessary when imaging/markers are diagnostic enough to proceed to therapeutic resection.  
• D: Observation delays treatment of a likely malignant lesion.

Oncologic staging steps (fertility-sparing):  
1) Midline incision; minimal tumor manipulation; protect field.  
2) Peritoneal washings before manipulation.  
3) Inspect contralateral ovary and peritoneal surfaces; biopsy only if suspicious.  
4) Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with vascular pedicle control early.  
5) Omentectomy (infracolic) if gross disease or per protocol.  
6) Sampling of suspicious lymph nodes; routine systematic dissection is not required in pediatric germ cell tumors.  
7) Avoid cyst rupture; send markers and pathology.  
8) Place port only if required later by oncology.

Adjuvant therapy: Most malignant ovarian germ cell tumors are highly chemosensitive (BEP regimen—bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin) based on pediatric cooperative group data (eg, COG/UKCCSG), with excellent survival when resected and treated promptly.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Large solid mass + high AFP → suspect yolk sac tumor.  
• Proceed to fertility-sparing oncologic laparotomy and staging.  
• Avoid laparoscopy/biopsy that risks rupture or seeding.  
• Pediatric germ cell tumors respond well to BEP.

"4","Ovarian masses","Question: A 7-year-old with vague lower abdominal pain is found to have a 5-cm adnexal cystic structure on physical exam. What is the best initial diagnostic test?","Pelvic ultrasound with Doppler","CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast","Pelvic MRI with contrast","Serum CA-125","","A","Correct Answer: A — Pelvic ultrasound with Doppler

Reasoning: Ultrasound is the first-line modality for pediatric adnexal masses—radiation-free, widely available, and excellent at characterizing cystic vs solid components, septations, nodules, and torsion features. Doppler adds information about venous/arterial flow, though absent flow is not required to diagnose torsion.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: CT involves ionizing radiation and is inferior to ultrasound/MRI for ovarian characterization in children; reserve for uncertain diagnoses or complications.  
• C: MRI offers superior soft-tissue characterization without radiation, but it is not the best initial test in most cases and often follows ultrasound.  
• D: CA-125 is nonspecific in children and should not be an initial test; marker panels are tailored after imaging suggests a neoplasm.

Diagnostic workflow: Start with ultrasound; if complex/solid or indeterminate, obtain markers (AFP, β-hCG, LDH; ± inhibin/estradiol/testosterone) and consider MRI. For simple cysts in prepubertal girls, many resolve; interval ultrasound is appropriate. Suspected torsion → urgent surgical exploration regardless of markers.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Ultrasound with Doppler is first-line for pediatric adnexal masses.  
• CT is rarely first choice due to radiation.  
• MRI is second-line for problem-solving.  
• Markers are guided by imaging and age/phenotype.

"5","Ovarian masses","Question: A 2-week-old neonate has a 6-cm simple unilocular ovarian cyst detected prenatally. She is feeding well, asymptomatic, and exam is benign. What is the next best step in management?","Observation with serial ultrasounds","Immediate laparoscopic cystectomy","Percutaneous aspiration under ultrasound guidance","Start hormonal suppression therapy","","A","Correct Answer: A — Observation with serial ultrasounds

Reasoning: Most antenatal/neonatal ovarian cysts are hormonally driven, simple, and self-resolving as maternal gonadotropins decline. Asymptomatic simple cysts ≤6 cm may be observed with interval ultrasound every 4–6 weeks. Intervention is considered for persistent growth, complex features (septations, echogenic debris suggesting hemorrhage/torsion), or symptoms from mass effect.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Immediate surgery risks loss of ovarian tissue; reserve for complicated, enlarging, or symptomatic cysts.  
• C: Percutaneous aspiration has high recurrence and risk of peritoneal spillage/infection; not standard first-line.  
• D: Hormonal suppression is not indicated in newborns for simple cysts.

Algorithm: Simple ≤4–6 cm → observe; >6–7 cm or complex → consider laparoscopic cystectomy or controlled drainage with cyst wall excision, prioritizing ovarian preservation. If torsed/auto-amputated cyst is suspected, resection of the cyst remnant may be needed; contralateral ovary should be evaluated.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Most neonatal simple cysts resolve; observe if ≤~6 cm and asymptomatic.  
• Operate for complex, enlarging, or symptomatic cysts.  
• Prioritize ovarian preservation during intervention.  
• Avoid percutaneous aspiration due to recurrence/spillage.

"6","Ovarian masses","Question: A 4-year-old girl presents with breast development, vaginal bleeding, and accelerated growth. Ultrasound shows a 6-cm solid ovarian mass. Which tumor marker is most helpful and what is the likely diagnosis?","Inhibin A/B — Juvenile granulosa cell tumor","AFP — Yolk sac tumor","β-hCG — Choriocarcinoma","LDH — Dysgerminoma","","A","Correct Answer: A — Inhibin A/B — Juvenile granulosa cell tumor

Reasoning: Estrogen-secreting sex cord–stromal tumors (juvenile granulosa cell tumors) cause isosexual precocious puberty in young girls. Inhibin A/B and estradiol are typically elevated. Imaging shows a solid or mixed mass; markers guide diagnosis and postoperative surveillance.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: AFP elevation suggests yolk sac tumor, which does not cause estrogenic symptoms.  
• C: β-hCG elevation may cause precocious puberty in boys (Leydig cell stimulation) and hyperemesis/uterine bleeding in gestational trophoblastic disease, but primary ovarian choriocarcinoma is exceedingly rare in children.  
• D: LDH elevates in dysgerminoma; these tumors are not estrogenic.

Management: Fertility-sparing unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with staging tailored to intraoperative findings; peritoneal washings and inspection of the contralateral ovary. Adjuvant therapy is uncommon for stage I juvenile granulosa tumors; prognosis is excellent with resection. Long-term follow-up is required due to late recurrences.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Precocious puberty + ovarian mass → think estrogenic stromal tumor.  
• Inhibin and estradiol are key markers.  
• Treat with fertility-sparing resection and staging.  
• Long-term follow-up is necessary for late relapse.

"7","Ovarian masses","Question: After detorsion of a first-time unilateral ovarian torsion in a 13-year-old without anatomic anomalies, what is the most appropriate management regarding oophoropexy?","No routine oophoropexy; observe and educate on recurrence signs","Bilateral oophoropexy to prevent future torsion","Contralateral oophoropexy only","Ipsilateral oophoropexy only","","A","Correct Answer: A — No routine oophoropexy; observe and educate on recurrence signs

Reasoning: Evidence does not support routine oophoropexy after a single unilateral torsion in otherwise normal anatomy. Oophoropexy is reserved for recurrent torsion, solitary ovary, Müllerian anomalies (eg, absent uterus, long ligaments), or markedly hypermobile ovaries.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Bilateral fixation is not indicated without specific risk factors; adds suture/ischemia risks.  
• C/D: Unilateral procedures are also not indicated routinely after a first event; choose selectively based on risk profile.

Technique (when indicated): Options include utero-ovarian ligament plication or fixation of the ovary to the lateral pelvic wall/uterosacral ligament with nonabsorbable sutures; avoid compromising tubal patency.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Routine oophoropexy is not recommended after first-time unilateral torsion.  
• Indications include recurrent torsion, solitary ovary, or Müllerian anomalies.  
• Educate patients/families; arrange ultrasound follow-up.

"8","Ovarian masses","Question: A 15-year-old with a 3.5-cm simple ovarian cyst on ultrasound, asymptomatic, normal markers. What is the best management?","Expectant management with repeat ultrasound in 6–8 weeks","Immediate laparoscopic cystectomy","Start combined oral contraceptives to hasten resolution","CT scan to confirm the finding","","A","Correct Answer: A — Expectant management with repeat ultrasound in 6–8 weeks

Reasoning: Simple cysts <5–6 cm in adolescents are usually physiologic and resolve spontaneously. Observation with interval ultrasound is appropriate. Hormonal therapy has limited evidence for hastening resolution of existing cysts and is not routinely necessary for a single incidental cyst.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Surgery is unnecessary for small, asymptomatic simple cysts.  
• C: OCPs may reduce new functional cysts but do not reliably shrink existing ones.  
• D: CT adds radiation without benefit.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Simple <5–6 cm cyst → observe and re-image.  
• Avoid unnecessary surgery and CT radiation.  
• OCPs not routinely needed to treat an existing cyst.

"9","Ovarian masses","Question: A 16-year-old has dyspnea and abdominal distension. Imaging shows a solid ovarian mass; chest x-ray shows a right pleural effusion; ascites is present. Tumor markers are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Ovarian fibroma (Meigs syndrome)","Yolk sac tumor","Dysgerminoma","Choriocarcinoma","","A","Correct Answer: A — Ovarian fibroma (Meigs syndrome)

Reasoning: Meigs syndrome is the triad of ovarian fibroma/fibrothecoma, ascites, and pleural effusion that resolve after tumor resection. Markers are typically normal; imaging shows a solid, often hypoechoic mass. While more common in adults, it can occur in adolescents and should be differentiated from malignant causes of effusions.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Yolk sac tumors elevate AFP and rarely present with Meigs physiology.  
• C: Dysgerminoma often elevates LDH and lacks the classic ascites/pleural effusion triad.  
• D: β-hCG would be elevated in choriocarcinoma.

Management: Fertility-sparing resection of the mass (ovarian-sparing if feasible) with histopathology confirmation; effusions typically resolve postoperatively. Evaluate for torsion given mass effect.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Ascites + pleural effusion + solid ovarian mass → consider Meigs (fibroma).  
• Tumor markers usually normal.  
• Effusions resolve after resection.

"10","Ovarian masses","Question: A 13-year-old phenotypic female with primary amenorrhea and short stature has a 5-cm solid ovarian mass. Imaging reveals a streak contralateral gonad and a hypoplastic uterus. Which tumor type is classically associated with gonadal dysgenesis, and what is the key management principle?","Dysgerminoma — remove tumor and evaluate/consider prophylactic gonadectomy of dysgenetic gonad","Mature teratoma — bilateral cystectomy","Yolk sac tumor — bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy","Granulosa cell tumor — chemotherapy first","","A","Correct Answer: A — Dysgerminoma — remove tumor and evaluate/consider prophylactic gonadectomy of dysgenetic gonad

Reasoning: Dysgerminomas are associated with gonadal dysgenesis and Y-chromosome material (eg, Swyer syndrome), and contralateral streak gonads carry a high risk of neoplasia (gonadoblastoma/dysgerminoma). Management includes fertility-sparing resection of the tumor and prophylactic removal of dysgenetic gonadal tissue harboring Y material, after appropriate karyotype evaluation and counseling.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Dermoids are not linked to dysgenesis; bilateral cystectomy is not indicated here.  
• C: Yolk sac tumors are not specifically associated with streak gonads; bilateral removal would sacrifice fertility unnecessarily.  
• D: Granulosa tumors are hormonally active; chemotherapy is not first-line for localized disease.

Key steps: Obtain karyotype (look for Y material), coordinate with endocrinology/genetics, perform unilateral tumor resection with staging; plan removal of dysgenetic contralateral tissue if Y positive, while preserving the normal uterus and any functional ovarian tissue if present.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Dysgerminoma is linked to gonadal dysgenesis/Y material.  
• Karyotype and prophylactic removal of dysgenetic gonad reduce malignancy risk.  
• Maintain fertility by preserving normal structures.

"11","Ovarian masses","Question: During laparoscopic cystectomy for a presumed dermoid in a 14-year-old, the cyst accidentally ruptures with sebaceous material spillage. What is the most appropriate intraoperative management?","Aggressive irrigation and suction with removal of dermoid contents; complete cyst wall excision; no peritoneal drains required","Convert to laparotomy for peritoneal lavage","Abort procedure and plan reoperation","Place intraperitoneal drains to prevent chemical peritonitis","","A","Correct Answer: A — Aggressive irrigation and suction with removal of dermoid contents; complete cyst wall excision; no peritoneal drains required

Reasoning: Accidental rupture of a benign dermoid can cause chemical peritonitis if sebaceous material remains. The correct response is thorough suction/irrigation, retrieval of all solid elements (hair, bone), and completion of the cystectomy. Drains are not routinely required if the peritoneal cavity is adequately cleaned.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Conversion is rarely necessary solely for spillage; laparoscopy can manage contamination.  
• C: Aborting leaves irritant material; proceed to complete safe resection.  
• D: Drains do not prevent chemical peritonitis if debris remains; lavage is key.

Prevention: Use an endobag for cystectomy and specimen retrieval; minimize electrocautery on the cortex to preserve follicles. Follow-up for recurrence is warranted (recurrence ~3–5% after cystectomy).

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Dermoid rupture → copious irrigation and complete wall excision.  
• Drains are not a substitute for adequate lavage.  
• Use endobags to prevent spillage.

What is the best next step in diagnostic workup?","Obtain tumor markers (AFP, β-hCG, LDH ± inhibin/estradiol/testosterone) and pelvic MRI","Proceed directly to emergent surgery","Start antibiotics for presumed tubo-ovarian abscess","Schedule interval ultrasound in 6 months","","A","Correct Answer: A — Obtain tumor markers (AFP, β-hCG, LDH ± inhibin/estradiol/testosterone) and pelvic MRI

Reasoning: A complex cyst warrants further characterization and a marker panel to stratify malignancy risk. MRI helps distinguish hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma, cystic neoplasm, or torsed cyst. Surgery is indicated if imaging/markers suggest neoplasm, symptoms escalate, or torsion is suspected clinically.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Without signs of acute torsion, immediate surgery is premature; complete the workup.  
• C: TOA is uncommon pre-menarche; lack of systemic infection argues against empiric antibiotics.  
• D: Six months is too long; earlier evaluation guides timely management.

Workup algorithm: Ultrasound → if complex/solid, add markers and MRI → if benign features and improving symptoms, short-interval US; if concerning features or markers positive, proceed to surgery with fertility-sparing principles.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Complex cysts need markers and MRI to refine risk.  
• Time surgery to symptoms and oncologic risk.  
• Short-interval follow-up if benign features and improving.

"13","Ovarian masses","Question: A 15-year-old undergoes unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for stage IC yolk sac tumor (capsule rupture at surgery). What is the standard postoperative oncologic management?","Adjuvant BEP chemotherapy","Observation with markers every 3 months","Radiation therapy to the pelvis","High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue","","A","Correct Answer: A — Adjuvant BEP chemotherapy

Reasoning: Pediatric malignant ovarian germ cell tumors beyond stage IA typically receive adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy (BEP: bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin). Capsule rupture (stage IC) increases relapse risk; adjuvant chemotherapy improves event-free survival per pediatric cooperative group trials (e.g., COG/UKCCSG).

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Observation is reasonable for stage IA dysgerminoma or completely resected stage I teratoma, not yolk sac tumor with capsular violation.  
• C: Radiation is not standard for yolk sac tumor and has significant gonadal/organ toxicity.  
• D: High-dose therapy is reserved for relapse/refractory disease.

Follow-up: Serial AFP every 2–4 weeks initially until normalization, then at increasing intervals; imaging per protocol. Monitor for BEP toxicities (ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, pulmonary with bleomycin). Fertility preservation discussions should occur pre-therapy when feasible.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Stage IC yolk sac tumor → adjuvant BEP.  
• Observation is inadequate due to relapse risk.  
• Monitor AFP closely and counsel on BEP toxicities.

"14","Ovarian masses","Question: A 11-year-old with classic torsion symptoms has an ultrasound that shows preserved arterial flow but enlarged ovary with peripheral follicles. What is the best next step?","Proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy for suspected torsion","Repeat ultrasound with a different sonographer","Discharge with outpatient follow-up","Order CT abdomen/pelvis","","A","Correct Answer: A — Proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy for suspected torsion

Reasoning: Ultrasound Doppler can be misleading; arterial flow may persist early or intermittently due to dual supply, while venous outflow is often first compromised. Clinical suspicion supersedes Doppler alone. Enlarged ovary with peripheral follicles (“string of pearls”) supports torsion; prompt laparoscopy is indicated.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Delays definitive care; torsion is time-sensitive.  
• C: Risk of ischemic loss with delay.  
• D: CT adds radiation and does not change management.

Intraoperative strategy: Detorse, preserve ovary, address associated cysts with controlled drainage or cystectomy if safe, assess contralateral side, and consider selective oophoropexy based on risk factors.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Clinical suspicion → laparoscopy even with arterial flow.  
• Venous compromise precedes arterial loss.  
• Preserve ovary after detorsion.

Markers are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis and initial management?","Endometrioma — medical management with gynecology; conservative surgery if refractory","Mature teratoma — laparoscopic cystectomy now","TOA — broad-spectrum antibiotics","Serous cystadenoma — immediate resection","","A","Correct Answer: A — Endometrioma — medical management with gynecology; conservative surgery if refractory

Reasoning: Homogeneous “ground glass” echogenicity suggests endometrioma. First-line therapy in adolescents is medical (eg, combined hormonal therapy, progestins) with gynecology. Surgery is reserved for refractory symptoms, rapid growth, or concerning features; aim for ovarian preservation and minimize cortical damage.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Dermoids have fat/calcifications, not “ground glass” homogeneity.  
• C: TOA would have systemic signs and complex septated collections; uncommon without STI risk.  
• D: Serous cystadenomas are typically anechoic with thin walls.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• “Ground glass” cyst → endometrioma.  
• Start with medical therapy; preserve ovarian reserve.  
• Operate selectively for refractory cases.

What is the most appropriate surgical plan?","Bilateral ovarian-sparing cystectomies using endobags, minimizing cortical damage","Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to bilaterality","Staged unilateral cystectomy now and observe the other side","Percutaneous drainage of both cysts","","A","Correct Answer: A — Bilateral ovarian-sparing cystectomies using endobags, minimizing cortical damage

Reasoning: Dermoids are benign; fertility-sparing cystectomy is standard, even when bilateral. Use endobags to prevent spillage; preserve as much normal cortex as possible. Staged approaches are not necessary unless operative time or circumstances dictate; drainage alone is inadequate and risks recurrence/chemical peritonitis.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Bilateral oophorectomy is excessive and sterilizing.  
• C: Observation is reasonable for small dermoids, but 6–7 cm lesions merit resection due to growth/torsion risk; doing both sides safely in one setting is typical.  
• D: Drainage without wall excision has high recurrence.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Treat bilateral dermoids with bilateral cystectomy, preserving cortex.  
• Use endobags to limit spillage.  
• Avoid oophorectomy in adolescents when feasible.

What is the best advice?","She may play; schedule repeat ultrasound in 6–8 weeks","Restrict from sports until cyst resolves","Proceed with cystectomy before returning to play","Start OCPs and allow unrestricted play","","A","Correct Answer: A — She may play; schedule repeat ultrasound in 6–8 weeks

Reasoning: Simple cysts ≤5–6 cm can be observed; no evidence mandates sports restriction for an asymptomatic physiologic cyst of this size. Provide return precautions for acute pain (possible torsion) and plan interval ultrasound.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Blanket restriction is not evidence-based for small simple cysts.  
• C: Surgery is unnecessary for an incidental small cyst.  
• D: OCPs are not required to treat an existing cyst and do not change immediate clearance.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Simple ≤5–6 cm cyst → observe; sports generally okay.  
• Educate on torsion symptoms and follow up imaging.

"18","Ovarian masses","Question: A 13-year-old has a 9-cm solid ovarian mass. AFP is 2,500 ng/mL (elevated), β-hCG normal, LDH normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumor","Dysgerminoma","Mature teratoma","Granulosa cell tumor","","A","Correct Answer: A — Yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumor

Reasoning: Markedly elevated AFP is characteristic of yolk sac tumors. Dysgerminoma typically has normal AFP and may have elevated LDH. Teratomas have normal markers; granulosa tumors elevate inhibin/estradiol.

Management: Fertility-sparing unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with staging, avoid rupture, and adjuvant BEP for stage ≥IC or residual disease per protocols.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• High AFP → yolk sac tumor until proven otherwise.  
• Dysgerminoma → LDH↑, AFP normal.  
• Treat with fertility-sparing resection ± BEP.

"19","Ovarian masses","Question: For a 10-cm complex ovarian mass suspected to be malignant based on imaging and elevated tumor markers, which statement is most accurate regarding preoperative tissue diagnosis?","Percutaneous needle biopsy is contraindicated due to seeding risk; proceed to oncologic resection","Image-guided biopsy is preferred to plan chemotherapy before surgery","Diagnostic laparoscopy with wedge biopsy is recommended","Observation with serial markers is first-line","","A","Correct Answer: A — Percutaneous needle biopsy is contraindicated due to seeding risk; proceed to oncologic resection

Reasoning: In pediatric ovarian masses with strong suspicion for malignancy, percutaneous biopsy risks tumor spillage and tract seeding and rarely changes the initial surgical approach. Proceed to therapeutic resection with fertility-sparing oncologic principles via laparotomy; histology will direct adjuvant therapy.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is uncommon in primary ovarian germ cell tumors unless unresectable/bulky disease; biopsy is not routine.  
• C: Wedge biopsy of a malignant-appearing mass risks rupture and is inferior to en bloc resection.  
• D: Observation is inappropriate with convincing malignancy.

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Avoid percutaneous biopsy in suspected malignant ovarian tumors.  
• Proceed to definitive, fertility-sparing oncologic resection and staging.

"20","Ovarian masses","Question: A 14-year-old with stage IA dysgerminoma underwent unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Which surveillance plan is most appropriate?","Serial LDH and pelvic imaging at decreasing intervals for 2–3 years with clinical exams; no adjuvant therapy","Adjuvant BEP chemotherapy followed by annual imaging only","Observation without labs or imaging after a negative first scan","Radiation therapy to the pelvis followed by LDH monitoring only","","A","Correct Answer: A — Serial LDH and pelvic imaging at decreasing intervals for 2–3 years with clinical exams; no adjuvant therapy

Reasoning: Stage IA dysgerminoma is often cured with surgery alone. Surveillance includes periodic clinical exams, LDH (± β-hCG), and pelvic imaging per protocol, with close intervals initially (eg, every 3–4 months in year 1) and spacing out to 2–3 years. Adjuvant BEP is not required in completely resected stage IA disease.

Why others are wrong:  
• B: Chemotherapy is not indicated in stage IA after complete resection.  
• C: Labs and imaging are necessary to detect early relapse.  
• D: Radiation is not standard and carries significant late toxicities.

Table: Example Follow-up (institutional protocols vary)
| Time from surgery | Clinic + labs | Imaging |
|---|---|---|
| 0–12 months | q3–4 mo (LDH ± β-hCG) | US/MRI q6 mo |
| 12–24 months | q4–6 mo | Annual |
| 24–36 months | q6–12 mo | Consider annual or as indicated |

Bottom Line/High Yield:
• Stage IA dysgerminoma → surgery alone, then surveillance.  
• Follow LDH and perform scheduled imaging.  
• Reserve BEP for higher-stage or recurrent disease.
