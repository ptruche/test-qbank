"1","ovarian_masses","A 14-year-old postmenarchal girl presents with 12 hours of right lower quadrant pain.     She is afebrile, WBC 8.5, pregnancy test negative. Pelvic ultrasound shows a 5.2-cm     enlarged right ovary with heterogeneous echotexture; arterial and venous flow are equivocal.     What is the next best step in management?","Observe with analgesia and repeat ultrasound in 24–48 hours","Immediate laparoscopic exploration with detorsion if torsion found","CT abdomen/pelvis to better evaluate the appendix","Start combined oral contraceptives to suppress functional cysts","Schedule elective oophorectomy within 1–2 weeks","B","Correct answer: B — Immediate laparoscopic exploration with detorsion if torsion found.
Acute pelvic pain in an adolescent with an enlarged, echogenic ovary and equivocal Doppler flow warrants timely diagnostic laparoscopy because ultrasound cannot reliably exclude torsion. Ovarian torsion is a clinical diagnosis; normal Doppler flow does not rule it out due to dual ovarian blood supply and intermittent torsion-detorsion. The operative priorities are: inspect both adnexa, assess for torsion, hemorrhage, rupture, or mass; perform peritoneal washings if a tumor is suspected; and evaluate upper abdomen/omentum for implants. If torsion is present, detorse and preserve the ovary, regardless of gross appearance, because the organ often recovers. If no discrete mass is identified and malignancy is unlikely, avoid blind oophorectomy; opt for conservative management and postoperative imaging follow-up.

Why the others are incorrect: Observation (A) risks ischemic loss of an ovary if torsion is present. CT for appendicitis (C) is unnecessary given a normal appendix on ultrasound and does not address the gynecologic emergency. Oral contraceptives (D) have no role in acute pain and do not prevent torsion; evidence that they reduce functional cyst formation in this setting is lacking. Elective oophorectomy (E) is inappropriate—malignancy is uncommon in children and ovarian-sparing principles apply unless clear malignant features mandate otherwise.

Practical pearls: obtain baseline tumor markers (AFP, hCG, CA‑125 ± CA 19‑9 if mucinous tumor suspected) preoperatively if a mass is possible, but do not delay urgent laparoscopy for results. During laparoscopy, aspirate free fluid for cytology and document the status of peritoneal surfaces, diaphragm, liver, and omentum if tumor is encountered."
"2","ovarian_masses","A 13-year-old girl has a 7-cm complex right ovarian mass discovered on ultrasound during     evaluation of intermittent pelvic pain. She is hemodynamically stable and scheduled for surgery today.     Which set of laboratory tests is most appropriate to obtain before the operation if possible?","CBC, CMP only","AFP, hCG, CA-125 (± CA 19-9 if mucinous tumor suspected)","LDH and ESR","Estradiol and progesterone levels","No labs are indicated because malignancy is rare in children","B","Correct answer: B — AFP, hCG, CA‑125 (± CA 19‑9 if mucinous tumor suspected).
Preoperative tumor markers guide intraoperative decision-making and postoperative surveillance. AFP suggests yolk sac tumor components; hCG suggests choriocarcinoma elements; CA‑125 may be elevated with epithelial malignancy and occasionally with germ cell tumors; CA 19‑9 can be associated with mucinous epithelial tumors. Elevations in AFP or hCG should make the surgeon avoid ovarian-sparing resection and minimize spill due to higher likelihood of malignancy. While immediate turnaround is ideal, baseline levels should be drawn even if results will return postoperatively.

Other options: CBC/CMP alone (A) misses disease-defining information. LDH/ESR (C) lack specificity here. Sex steroid levels (D) are not helpful for the differential of an adnexal mass. Skipping labs (E) is inappropriate; although pediatric ovarian malignancy is uncommon (~10%), marker data meaningfully alter operative strategy and follow-up.

Takeaway: obtain markers preoperatively when operating on a suspected ovarian mass; do not delay urgent torsion management solely for markers."
"3","ovarian_masses","During laparoscopy for an ovarian mass in a 12-year-old, which intraoperative steps constitute     appropriate staging for a suspected germ cell tumor?","Peritoneal washings; inspection of liver, diaphragm, and omentum; biopsy of suspicious lesions","Bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy regardless of gross findings","Omentectomy and systematic pelvic nodal sampling in all cases","Frozen section of contralateral ovary","Peritoneal washings only","A","Correct answer: A — Peritoneal washings; inspection of liver, diaphragm, and omentum; biopsy of suspicious lesions; inspect contralateral ovary.
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) staging for ovarian germ cell tumors emphasizes peritoneal washings and thorough inspection of peritoneal surfaces and upper abdomen, with biopsy of any suspicious lesions and assessment of iliac nodes for enlargement. Routine lymphadenectomy or omentectomy is not mandated for all pediatric germ cell tumors; staging should be tailored to findings. The contralateral ovary should be inspected but not biopsied unless visibly abnormal.

Why others are wrong: Routine pelvic/para-aortic lymphadenectomy (B) and mandatory omentectomy with nodal sampling (C) reflect adult epithelial cancer practice (FIGO), not standard pediatric germ cell staging. Frozen section of a normal contralateral ovary (D) risks fertility without benefit. Washings alone (E) are incomplete.

Operative nuance: If malignant elements are suspected, minimize spill and use a retrieval bag. When ovarian preservation is safe (e.g., benign teratoma with negative markers), carefully enucleate the mass, preserving normal parenchyma."
"4","ovarian_masses","A 14-year-old has a persistently enlarged right ovary on ultrasound 4 weeks after laparoscopy that     showed no discrete tumor. Pain persists despite NSAIDs. What is the best next diagnostic study?","Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis","MRI pelvis with and without fat-suppressed sequences","Nuclear medicine bone scan","Repeat ultrasound immediately","No further imaging; proceed to oophorectomy","B","Correct answer: B — MRI pelvis with and without fat-suppressed sequences.
MRI provides superior soft-tissue characterization for adnexal lesions, delineates fat and fluid components, and helps distinguish functional cysts from neoplasms. Fat-suppressed sequences identify macroscopic fat of teratomas. MRI also clarifies borders between tumor and normal ovarian tissue, informing feasibility of ovarian-sparing enucleation.

CT (A) exposes to ionizing radiation without better tissue characterization. Immediate repeat ultrasound (D) adds little after multiple equivocal studies. Bone scan (C) is irrelevant. Proceeding directly to oophorectomy (E) contradicts pediatric principles of ovarian preservation in the absence of clear malignancy.

Clinical pearl: MRI confirmation of a small fatty mass consistent with mature teratoma supports planned Pfannenstiel minilaparotomy for controlled, no‑spillage enucleation with ovarian preservation."
"5","ovarian_masses","A 15-year-old with MRI-proven 3.6-cm right ovarian dermoid (mature cystic teratoma), normal AFP and hCG.     What is the preferred operative strategy?","Laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy to avoid rupture","Pfannenstiel minilaparotomy with ovarian-sparing tumor enucleation","Open midline laparotomy with total hysterectomy","Expectant management only","Cyst aspiration and cauterization of the cavity","B","Correct answer: B — Pfannenstiel minilaparotomy with ovarian-sparing tumor enucleation.
For benign dermoids in adolescents, ovarian preservation is the standard when feasible. A small Pfannenstiel incision allows tactile assessment and deliberate capsulotomy to enucleate the mass from normal parenchyma while minimizing spill. Even when performed laparoscopically, careful technique and an endoscopic retrieval bag are essential; many surgeons favor minilaparotomy for optimal control.

Salpingo-oophorectomy (A) sacrifices fertility and is unnecessary in benign disease. Midline laparotomy with hysterectomy (C) is inappropriate. Pure observation (D) risks growth, torsion, or rupture. Aspiration (E) leads to spillage and recurrence; it is contraindicated.

Technical tip: Enucleate “like a hard‑boiled egg yolk,” preserving an adequate ovarian remnant for future function."
"6","ovarian_masses","A resected 4-cm ovarian teratoma from a 12-year-old is sent to pathology. Which sampling approach is most appropriate?","One representative section of the cyst wall is sufficient","Sample ≥1 section per centimeter of maximal diameter to evaluate for immature/malignant elements","Only sample areas with calcifications or hair","No histology is required for small dermoids","Frozen section only; permanent sections add little value","B","Correct answer: B — Sample at least one section per centimeter of maximal diameter.
Teratomas display heterogeneous histology. Generous sampling is required to detect immature neuroepithelium or malignant components such as yolk sac tumor; the latter may be focal. The final report should designate benign vs malignant and note any immature elements. In pediatric patients, even high-grade immaturity does not necessarily mandate chemotherapy if stage I; surgery alone is often curative.

Limited sampling (A, C) risks missing critical elements. Skipping histology (D) is unsafe. Frozen section alone (E) can be misleading; definitive diagnosis relies on permanent sections with adequate sampling.

Clinical impact: Discovery of malignant elements upstages disease and alters adjuvant therapy and surveillance."
"7","ovarian_masses","A 16-year-old underwent ovarian-sparing resection of a mature cystic teratoma with negative markers.     What is the most appropriate follow-up plan?","Annual pelvic ultrasound until adulthood; educate about 10–20% contralateral metachronous risk","No follow-up is needed after complete resection","Quarterly AFP and hCG levels for 5 years","Routine chemotherapy due to recurrence risk","Immediate oophorectomy of the contralateral ovary","A","Correct answer: A — Annual pelvic ultrasound until adulthood with counseling on contralateral risk.
Mature teratoma recurrence in the ipsilateral ovary is uncommon after complete enucleation, but metachronous contralateral teratomas occur in roughly 10–20% at 10 years. Periodic ultrasound (e.g., at 6 months and then yearly) is a reasonable approach. Tumor markers are not useful if they were normal preoperatively.

No follow-up (B) misses metachronous disease. Marker surveillance (C) is not informative. Chemotherapy (D) has no role in benign disease. Prophylactic contralateral oophorectomy (E) is contraindicated and harmful.

Counseling point: Educate patients about symptoms of torsion and the importance of routine surveillance."
"8","ovarian_masses","A 15-year-old with recurrent functional ovarian cysts asks about combined oral contraceptives to prevent new cysts.     What is the evidence-based recommendation?","OCPs clearly reduce formation of functional cysts and should be prescribed","OCPs have not been shown to reduce cyst incidence and are not indicated solely for this purpose","OCPs increase the risk of ovarian torsion","OCPs are contraindicated after dermoid cystectomy","OCPs should be started preoperatively to reduce tumor rupture risk","B","Correct answer: B — OCPs have not demonstrated reduction in functional cyst incidence when used solely for that purpose.
While OCPs are frequently prescribed to “stabilize” hormonal cycling, evidence does not support their use specifically to prevent functional cysts in adolescents. They may still be used for contraception or cycle regulation, but not as cyst prophylaxis. There is no evidence that OCPs reduce torsion risk or alter perioperative outcomes in ovarian mass surgery.

Options A, C, D, and E are unsupported or incorrect.

Practical counseling: Consider alternative strategies—expectant observation with interval ultrasound and reassurance—unless cysts are symptomatic or complicated."
"9","ovarian_masses","A 15-year-old has a large ovarian mass with intraoperative rupture and glial implants on the peritoneum.     Tumor markers are normal. Final pathology shows immature teratoma, no malignant germ cell elements.     Which statement is most accurate?","Peritoneal glial implants represent metastasis and upstage the tumor","Glial implants (gliomatosis peritonei) arise from metaplasia of submesothelial cells and do not upstage","Adjuvant chemotherapy is mandatory for all immature teratomas","Spillage invariably worsens outcome in children","Contralateral oophorectomy is recommended","B","Correct answer: B — Glial implants (gliomatosis peritonei) are benign metaplastic implants that do not upstage.
Intraoperative rupture of dermoids can scatter sebaceous material and neural tissue; glial nodules discovered later represent metaplasia rather than true metastasis. In pediatric series, immaturity grade has limited prognostic impact compared with adult counterparts, and surgery alone is adequate for stage I disease even with high-grade immaturity. Routine chemotherapy is not indicated unless malignant components (e.g., yolk sac tumor) or advanced stage are present. Evidence that spillage worsens outcome in children is limited, though minimizing spill remains good practice.

Therefore, adjuvant chemotherapy (C) and contralateral oophorectomy (E) are unnecessary. Spillage (D) should be avoided but is not clearly associated with worse pediatric outcomes."
"10","ovarian_masses","A 13-year-old with a large ovarian mass has ultrasound features suggestive of teratoma. AFP is 145 ng/mL (elevated),     hCG normal. CT shows no extra-ovarian disease. What is the most appropriate operative approach?","Ovarian-sparing enucleation via minilaparotomy","Salpingo-oophorectomy with careful avoidance of spill","Percutaneous aspiration to decompress before surgery","Two-stage approach: biopsy now, definitive resection after chemotherapy","Pure laparoscopic cyst unroofing","B","Correct answer: B — Salpingo-oophorectomy with careful avoidance of spill.
Elevated AFP implies yolk sac tumor components within a teratoma (malignant teratoma). Ovarian-sparing surgery risks leaving malignant tissue behind and spilling tumor, potentially upstaging the patient. The appropriate approach is salpingo‑oophorectomy with staging, using a retrieval bag and minimizing rupture; obtain washings and inspect peritoneal surfaces. Postoperatively, AFP kinetics guide surveillance or adjuvant therapy.

Enucleation (A) and cyst unroofing (E) are inappropriate in suspected malignancy. Aspiration (C) is contraindicated. Routine initial biopsy with delay (D) is unnecessary and risks seeding.

Key point: In adolescents, AFP or hCG elevation shifts strategy from preservation toward oncologic control."
"11","ovarian_masses","A 12-year-old phenotypic girl with primary amenorrhea is found to have a solid ovarian mass.     Karyotype reveals 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Which tumor type is most classically associated?","Dysgerminoma","Yolk sac tumor","Mucinous cystadenoma","Granulosa cell tumor","Thecoma","A","Correct answer: A — Dysgerminoma.
Dysgerminoma is the ovarian analogue of seminoma and is associated with dysgenetic gonads (including 46,XY). It presents as a solid, homogenous mass and may elevate LDH; AFP/hCG are typically normal unless mixed elements exist. Management emphasizes staging and salpingo-oophorectomy on the affected side; contralateral gonad management depends on anatomy and malignancy risk in gonadal dysgenesis.

Yolk sac tumor (B) typically elevates AFP. Mucinous cystadenoma (C) is epithelial and less related to dysgenesis. Granulosa cell tumor (D) and thecoma (E) are sex cord–stromal tumors associated with estrogenic effects rather than dysgenetic karyotypes.

Fertility considerations and endocrinology consultation are essential in patients with gonadal dysgenesis."
"12","ovarian_masses","A 17-year-old with a large multiloculated cystic ovarian mass has features concerning for mucinous epithelial tumor.     Which staging principle best reflects pediatric management?","FIGO staging with omentectomy and nodal sampling is standard for all pediatric ovarian tumors","COG germ cell staging applies to mucinous tumors","Suspicious epithelial tumors may be staged per FIGO, but the relevance in pediatrics is not definitively proven","No staging is required if CA-125 is normal","Routine bilateral oophorectomy is recommended","C","Correct answer: C — Suspicious epithelial tumors may be staged per FIGO, but pediatric applicability is uncertain.
In adolescents with epithelial tumors (often mucinous), many surgeons follow adult FIGO principles—omentectomy, peritoneal washings, and nodal sampling—when malignancy is suspected. However, the evidence base in pediatrics is limited, and individualized ovarian-preserving strategies should be considered when oncologically safe. Tumor markers (including CA 19‑9 for mucinous tumors) may aid diagnosis and surveillance.

Applying FIGO universally (A) or COG germ cell staging to epithelial tumors (B) is inappropriate. Normal CA‑125 (D) does not obviate staging if malignancy is suspected. Routine bilateral oophorectomy (E) is contrary to fertility-preserving principles."
"13","ovarian_masses","An 8-year-old girl presents with premature vaginal bleeding and a large complex ovarian mass.     Which serum marker is most helpful and what behavior is expected?","Inhibin; juvenile subtype can be aggressive with early recurrence","CA 19-9; benign course is typical","AFP; platinum-based chemotherapy is never indicated","LDH; dysgerminomas are expected","hCG; choriocarcinoma predominates","A","Correct answer: A — Inhibin; juvenile granulosa cell tumors can be aggressive with early recurrence.
Granulosa-stromal cell tumors are the most common functioning ovarian neoplasms in young girls and often present with isosexual pseudoprecocious puberty. Inhibin is a useful tumor marker and immunostain. Juvenile subtypes may recur early and, when extra-ovarian disease or rupture is present, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended. Histology shows follicle-like spaces with characteristic cytology and inhibin positivity.

CA 19‑9 (B) aligns more with mucinous epithelial tumors. AFP (C) is for yolk sac elements. LDH (D) relates to dysgerminoma but is not the key feature here. hCG (E) is a marker of choriocarcinoma.

Surgical note: Aim for complete resection with staging; fertility-sparing approaches apply when oncologically sound."
"14","ovarian_masses","A 9-year-old girl has torsion of an ovary containing a cystic teratoma. The tissue is hemorrhagic and     planes are indistinct. What ovarian-preserving strategy is most appropriate in this setting?","Complete oophorectomy to avoid residual tumor","Hilar wedge resection to preserve viable parenchyma when enucleation is not feasible","Blind cyst aspiration and cautery","Immediate second-look surgery in 48 hours","Convert to midline laparotomy and perform hysterectomy","B","Correct answer: B — Hilar wedge resection when enucleation is impossible in the torsed, hemorrhagic ovary.
In torsion, edema and hemorrhage obscure planes, making classic “yolk-like” enucleation unsafe. A judicious hilar resection can remove the tumor while retaining viable ovarian tissue. Detorse first and preserve the ovary whenever possible; many reperfused ovaries regain function. Final pathology and markers dictate further management.

Oophorectomy (A) is often avoidable. Aspiration (C) risks spill and recurrence. Planned second-look (D) is not standard. Hysterectomy (E) is never indicated.

Follow-up ultrasound typically shows a smaller but viable ovary months later."
"15","ovarian_masses","A 13-year-old underwent salpingo-oophorectomy for malignant teratoma (stage I) with elevated AFP that normalized postoperatively.     What surveillance is most appropriate?","No follow-up needed after normalization","Quarterly AFP levels with imaging as indicated, as recurrences can be salvaged with chemotherapy","Immediate adjuvant chemotherapy for all stage I cases","Annual CA-125 levels only","Monthly PET/CT scans for 2 years","B","Correct answer: B — Quarterly AFP surveillance with imaging as indicated.
Stage I malignant teratoma in children is often managed with surgery alone followed by close surveillance. Rising AFP heralds recurrence; early detection permits effective salvage with platinum-based regimens (e.g., PEB: carboplatin, etoposide, bleomycin). Routine adjuvant chemotherapy is not universally required in stage I disease if complete resection and marker normalization occur.

Skipping follow-up (A) risks delayed detection. Automatic chemotherapy (C) may overtreat. CA‑125 (D) is not the correct marker. Routine PET/CT (E) exposes children to unnecessary radiation and lacks proven benefit.

Counseling: Emphasize adherence to marker schedules and prompt evaluation of new symptoms."
"16","ovarian_masses","A 12-year-old presents with an incidental 4.5-cm simple ovarian cyst on ultrasound, asymptomatic.     Pregnancy test is negative. What is the best management?","Immediate cystectomy","Expectant management with repeat ultrasound in 6–8 weeks","Start chemotherapy","CT scan to better characterize","Percutaneous aspiration under ultrasound guidance","B","Correct answer: B — Expectant management with interval ultrasound.
Simple cysts <5–6 cm in asymptomatic adolescents are usually functional and resolve spontaneously. Observation with follow-up ultrasound is appropriate. Operative intervention is reserved for persistent, enlarging, symptomatic, or complex lesions.

Cystectomy (A) is unnecessary. Chemotherapy (C) is irrelevant. CT (D) adds radiation without benefit over ultrasound. Aspiration (E) risks recurrence and spill and is not recommended."
"17","ovarian_masses","Which imaging feature most strongly suggests mature cystic teratoma (dermoid) on MRI?","Restricted diffusion within solid components","Uniform T2 hypointensity","Macroscopic fat with signal dropout on fat-suppressed sequences","Peripheral nodular enhancement","Marked ascites with peritoneal thickening","C","Correct answer: C — Macroscopic fat with fat-suppressed signal dropout.
Dermoids contain macroscopic fat, hair, and sebaceous material. Fat saturation techniques on MRI confirm fat, making the diagnosis highly likely. Ultrasound may show echogenic components with shadowing; CT shows low-attenuation fat and calcifications (e.g., teeth).

Restricted diffusion (A) is nonspecific. Uniform T2 hypointensity (B) is atypical. Peripheral nodular enhancement (D) suggests hemangioma-like lesions. Ascites with peritoneal thickening (E) raises concern for malignancy rather than benign dermoid."
"18","ovarian_masses","During resection of a suspected benign dermoid in a 14-year-old, which technique best minimizes intraperitoneal spill?","Cyst aspiration with suction prior to removal","Use of an endoscopic retrieval bag and deliberate extracorporeal cystotomy if needed","Leaving the cyst in situ to desiccate","Sharp curettage of the cyst wall","No special measures are necessary; spill does not matter","B","Correct answer: B — Use a retrieval bag and controlled extracorporeal cystotomy if needed.
Although pediatric data do not clearly show worse outcomes with spill, minimizing spillage is prudent to avoid chemical peritonitis and glial seeding. Place the intact specimen in a bag; if decompression is necessary for extraction, perform controlled drainage within the bag.

Aspiration in the peritoneal cavity (A) invites spill. Desiccation (C) and curettage (D) are inappropriate. Dismissing spill (E) is poor surgical practice."
"19","ovarian_masses","A 16-year-old with a giant multiloculated ovarian cyst has elevated CA 19-9, normal AFP/hCG/CA-125.     This profile most suggests which tumor type?","Mucinous epithelial tumor (borderline or benign)","Dysgerminoma","Granulosa cell tumor","Yolk sac tumor","Thecoma","A","Correct answer: A — Mucinous epithelial tumor.
CA 19‑9 can be elevated in mucinous ovarian tumors; imaging often reveals a multiloculated cyst with variable signal intensities corresponding to different mucin viscosities. Management may involve controlled aspiration to reduce size for safe extraction, followed by pathologic evaluation to determine benign, borderline, or malignant features. Surveillance integrates physical exam, ultrasound, and CA 19‑9 trends.

Dysgerminoma (B) may elevate LDH. Granulosa (C) is inhibin‑positive. Yolk sac (D) elevates AFP. Thecoma (E) is rare and hormonally active rather than marker‑driven."
"20","ovarian_masses","After ovarian-sparing dermoid cystectomy, which counseling point is most accurate?","Future fertility is typically preserved with a substantial ovarian remnant","All patients require chemotherapy","Pregnancy is contraindicated for 5 years","Contralateral oophorectomy reduces recurrence risk","Oral contraceptives prevent recurrence","A","Correct answer: A — Fertility is generally preserved after ovarian-sparing resection.
Preserving normal ovarian parenchyma maintains endocrine function and fertility potential. Recurrence risk is low ipsilaterally but metachronous contralateral dermoids occur in a minority; routine oophorectomy is not indicated. Chemotherapy is not used for benign teratomas, and OCPs do not prevent recurrence.

Advise routine ultrasound surveillance and prompt evaluation for acute torsion symptoms."
"21","ovarian_masses","A 13-year-old has a 5.5-cm complex ovarian cyst with internal echoes and septations two weeks after menses.     She is mildly symptomatic. Tumor markers are normal. Which statement is most accurate?","Hemorrhagic functional cyst cannot be distinguished from neoplasm on ultrasound alone; MRI can help","Normal markers exclude malignancy","Immediate oophorectomy is indicated","Aspiration confirms diagnosis","CA-125 level should guide between surgery and observation","A","Correct answer: A — Ultrasound alone may be inconclusive; MRI can differentiate functional from neoplastic lesions.
Hemorrhagic cysts can mimic neoplasms sonographically. MRI clarifies composition and margins, aiding the decision between observation and surgery. Normal markers decrease but do not eliminate malignancy risk; surgical planning still follows imaging and clinical context.

Immediate oophorectomy (C) is excessive. Aspiration (D) is discouraged. CA‑125 (E) lacks specificity for decision-making in adolescents."
"22","ovarian_masses","During laparoscopy for suspected torsion, no discrete mass is present but the ovary is enlarged and edematous.     What is the best course?","Terminate the procedure and follow with serial imaging; avoid blind oophorectomy","Perform wedge resection to reduce size","Proceed with oophorectomy to prevent future torsion","Perform cyst unroofing blindly","Convert to laparotomy for full exploration","A","Correct answer: A — Terminate and follow with imaging when no mass is identified.
In the absence of a discrete lesion or malignant concern, conservative management after detorsion is appropriate. The ovary often recovers spontaneously. Blind resection risks unnecessary loss of ovarian tissue and complications. Postoperative ultrasound or MRI monitors resolution and detects any evolving lesion.

Wedge resection (B) or blind unroofing (D) are inappropriate. Oophorectomy (C) sacrifices fertility. Conversion (E) is unnecessary."
"23","ovarian_masses","A 13-year-old previously managed surgically for malignant teratoma returns one year later with diffuse peritoneal disease     and AFP 2,000 ng/mL. What chemotherapy is commonly used for salvage?","Carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEB)","Doxorubicin and ifosfamide","Methotrexate and vinblastine","Cyclophosphamide and topotecan","Imatinib","A","Correct answer: A — Carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEB).
Platinum-based regimens (PEB) are standard for malignant ovarian germ cell tumors and are effective for salvage after recurrence. Tumor marker response guides the number of cycles and duration. Multidisciplinary care with pediatric oncology is essential.

Other regimens listed are not standard for ovarian germ cell malignancies in children."
"24","ovarian_masses","Pathology from a 15-year-old with a large mucinous tumor shows >10% epithelial proliferation with stratification,     tufting, and filiform papillae but no stromal invasion. Which diagnosis fits best?","Benign mucinous cystadenoma","Borderline mucinous tumor","Invasive mucinous carcinoma","Immature teratoma","Granulosa cell tumor","B","Correct answer: B — Borderline mucinous tumor.
Borderline tumors show epithelial proliferation and atypia without stromal invasion. Pediatric cases are uncommon; complete resection with careful staging and surveillance is typical. CA 19‑9 may be elevated and can normalize after resection.

Benign cystadenoma (A) lacks proliferation. Invasive carcinoma (C) shows stromal invasion. Immature teratoma (D) is a germ cell tumor with neuroepithelial elements. Granulosa cell tumor (E) is sex cord–stromal with estrogenic activity and inhibin positivity."
"25","ovarian_masses","In pediatric ovarian germ cell tumors, what is the recommended approach to lymph nodes?","Systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy for all patients","Biopsy/en bloc removal only of clinically or radiographically suspicious nodes","Skip nodal assessment entirely","Sentinel lymph node mapping","Fine needle aspiration of all pelvic nodes","B","Correct answer: B — Target suspicious nodes only.
Pediatric germ cell tumor staging emphasizes inspection and biopsy of suspicious nodes rather than routine lymphadenectomy. This limits morbidity while providing adequate staging information in the context of effective chemotherapy for metastatic disease when present.

Systematic dissection (A) is more aligned with adult epithelial cancer. Skipping nodes (C) risks understaging. Sentinel mapping (D) and blanket FNA (E) are not standard."
"26","ovarian_masses","Which scenario most strongly favors ovarian-sparing resection over salpingo-oophorectomy?","Dermoid with normal AFP/hCG and no extra-ovarian disease","Solid mass with markedly elevated AFP","Mixed solid-cystic mass with high hCG","Ruptured mass with glial implants and elevated AFP","Gross peritoneal implants on inspection","A","Correct answer: A — Dermoid with normal AFP/hCG and no extra-ovarian disease.
Normal germ cell markers and classic imaging favor benign teratoma, for which ovarian preservation is standard. Elevated AFP or hCG (B, C, D) suggests malignant elements; oophorectomy with staging is preferred. Gross implants (E) indicate advanced disease, arguing against preservation."
"27","ovarian_masses","A 15-year-old with a massive multiloculated ovarian cyst causing respiratory compromise is scheduled for resection.     What intraoperative strategy facilitates safe removal?","Uncontrolled intra-abdominal puncture of cysts to decompress","Controlled aspiration of cyst fluid after securing the field to prevent spillage, then extraction","Percutaneous drainage days before surgery","Immediate midline laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy","Leave tumor in place and start neoadjuvant chemotherapy","B","Correct answer: B — Controlled aspiration with precautions against spillage.
Giant mucinous tumors may require volume reduction for safe mobilization and extraction. Controlled drainage—using purse-string sutures, suction, and containment—minimizes spillage and facilitates resection through a transverse incision. Final pathology distinguishes benign vs borderline vs malignant features and directs follow-up.

Uncontrolled puncture (A) risks chemical peritonitis and seeding. Preoperative percutaneous drainage (C) is discouraged. Hysterectomy (D) is excessive. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (E) has no role without confirmed malignancy."
"28","ovarian_masses","Two weeks after dermoid cystectomy complicated by intraperitoneal spillage, a 16-year-old presents with     abdominal pain and low-grade fever. Imaging shows small-volume ascites with fat-fluid levels. Most likely diagnosis?","Bacterial peritonitis","Chemical peritonitis from sebaceous material","Pulmonary embolism","Bowel injury","Ovarian vein thrombosis","B","Correct answer: B — Chemical peritonitis from spilled sebaceous contents.
Dermoid spillage can incite sterile inflammatory peritonitis with fat-fluid levels on imaging. Management ranges from supportive care and anti-inflammatories to laparoscopic lavage if symptoms persist. Prevention hinges on meticulous containment and bag use during resection.

Bacterial peritonitis (A) would present with higher fever and leukocytosis; cultures may be negative in chemical peritonitis. Other options (C–E) do not match the imaging and clinical course."
"29","ovarian_masses","Which distribution best reflects the relative frequencies of ovarian tumor categories in children/adolescents?","Epithelial majority; germ cell minority; rare sex cord–stromal","Germ cell majority (~75–80%); epithelial minority (~15%); sex cord–stromal rare (~5%)","Equal distribution among all three","Sex cord–stromal majority","Epithelial 50%, germ cell 40%, sex cord–stromal 10%","B","Correct answer: B — Germ cell tumors predominate (~75–80%), epithelial ~15%, sex cord–stromal ~5%.
In contrast to adults, where epithelial tumors predominate, pediatric ovarian tumors are mostly germ cell, with epithelial and sex cord–stromal tumors comprising smaller fractions. This epidemiology underpins the emphasis on germ cell markers and fertility-preserving strategies in children.

Understanding the distribution helps tailor differential diagnosis, workup, and operative planning."
"30","ovarian_masses","Oral boards scenario: A 14-year-old with acute pelvic pain has ultrasound showing an enlarged ovary     and normal arterial Doppler flow. How do you proceed and justify your decision?","Reassure and discharge; normal Doppler excludes torsion","Admit and observe; repeat ultrasound tomorrow","Proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy because Doppler does not exclude torsion","Obtain MRI to further assess perfusion","Start anticoagulation for ovarian vein thrombosis","C","Correct answer: C — Proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy.
Ovarian torsion is a clinical diagnosis and Doppler studies can be falsely reassuring due to dual blood supply and intermittent torsion-detorsion. The risk of losing a potentially salvageable ovary outweighs the low morbidity of laparoscopy. Intraoperatively, detorse if torsion is present; avoid oophorectomy for color alone; assess for mass, perform washings if indicated, and evaluate peritoneal surfaces. If no mass is identified, avoid blind resection and arrange postoperative imaging follow-up.

Discharging (A) or delaying (B) risks ovarian loss. MRI (D) is unnecessary in the acute setting. Anticoagulation (E) is not indicated without evidence of thrombosis."
