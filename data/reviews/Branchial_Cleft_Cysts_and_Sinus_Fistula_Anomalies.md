title: Branchial Cleft Cysts and Sinus/Fistula Anomalies
subject: Head & Neck / Branchial Anomalies
---

## Embryology  
- Six branchial (pharyngeal) arches form between weeks 4‑7; each arch is separated externally by an ectodermal cleft and internally by an endodermal pouch.  
- The 2nd arch overgrows the 3rd & 4th, forming the **cervical sinus of His**, which normally involutes. Failure of involution → branchial cysts/sinuses/fistulae.  
- Terminology:  
  - **Cyst** = epithelial‐lined remnant with no external or internal opening.  
  - **Sinus** = communication to either skin or pharynx.  
  - **Fistula** = tract connecting both skin and pharynx.

## Classification & Key Anatomy  
| Cleft | Approx % | Surface Location | Surgical/Anatomic Relations | Internal Opening |
|-------|----------|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| **1st** | 5‑8% | Preauricular / parotid region | Tracks near facial nerve, EAC, parotid | EAC or middle ear |
| **2nd** | ~90% | Anterior border SCM (upper/mid) | Between ICA & ECA; under CN XII; over CN IX | Tonsillar fossa |
| **3rd** | <3% | Lower neck / thyroid region | Posterior to CN IX; over SLN; pierces thyrohyoid membrane | Piriform sinus (sup) |
| **4th** | Rare (often L) | Lower neck / upper mediastinum | Loops around aortic arch (L) or subclavian (R); deep thyroid | Piriform apex |

## Clinical Presentation  
- **Age:** Often childhood or adolescence, though may present later if fistula remains silent.  
- **Typical findings:** Painless fluctuant mass in the lateral neck; may appear/enlarge after URI or with infection.  
- **External openings:** For fistula/sinus, usually along anterior SCM border.  
- **1st cleft:** Preauricular/parotid swelling ± ear discharge.  
- **3rd/4th clefts:** Recurrent deep neck abscess or thyroiditis (especially left side for 4th).  

---

## Diagnosis & Work‑Up  
- **Ultrasound:** first line; identifies cystic vs solid, depth relative to SCM.  
- **CT/MRI:** use for recurrent/infected cases or to delineate tract near carotids/cranial nerves.  
- **Endoscopy:** evaluate internal opening (tonsillar fossa for 2nd, piriform for 3rd/4th).  
- **Important:** Avoid blind incision & drainage unless emergent — increases scar and recurrence risk.

---

## Management Principles  
- Treat active infection (antibiotics ± drainage) **before** definitive surgery.  
- Definitive goal: **complete excision of cyst/tract** to mucosal origin and internal opening when present.  
- Protect key neurovascular structures: facial nerve (1st), CN IX/X/XII (2nd–4th), superior/recurrent laryngeal nerves (3rd/4th).  
- Use nerve monitoring where risk is high (e.g., 1st cleft near parotid).  
- For 3rd/4th clefts especially: **endoscopic assessment/cauterization** of internal opening reduces recurrence.

---

## Operative Strategy by Cleft  
### 1st Branchial Cleft  
- **Approach:** parotidectomy‑type incision; locate main trunk of facial nerve early (tragal pointer/digastric).  
- Dissect tract through/near parotid; identify relation to facial nerve branches.  
- Excision includes any involved skin, EAC cartilage if present.  
- **Pitfall:** failure to identify facial nerve → paralysis.  

### 2nd Branchial Cleft  
- **Incision:** transverse skin crease over upper/mid SCM or step‑ladder for long fistulae.  
- Dissect superficial to SCM; follow tract superiorly **between ICA/ECA**, under XII, over IX.  
- **Internal opening:** tonsillar fossa — may require tonsillectomy or mucosal ligation.  
- **Pitfall:** missing internal opening → recurrence; injury to carotids/nerve.  

### 3rd Branchial Cleft  
- Often presents as recurrent lower neck or thyroid region abscess.  
- Confirm internal piriform sinus opening endoscopically.  
- Incision low anterior neck; trace tract posterior to CN IX, above SLN, through thyrohyoid membrane.  
- Internal opening cauterized or ligated.  
- **Pitfall:** misdiagnosis as thyroiditis; inadequate tract excision.  

### 4th Branchial Cleft  
- Rare — usually left side, recurrent thyroiditis.  
- Tract descends into mediastinum, loops around arch/subclavian, ascends to piriform apex.  
- **Surgical plan:** control infection, then open excision ± partial thyroid lobectomy; or endoscopic only. Protect recurrent & superior laryngeal nerves.  
- **Pitfall:** in adults, cystic neck mass can mimic metastatic lymph node; always examine for malignancy.  

---

## Postoperative Key Points  
- Drain if preoperative infection/inflammation.  
- Monitor for hematoma, nerve deficits, salivary leak (1st cleft).  
- Recurrence rate <5% if complete excision and infection cleared.  
- Re‑operation higher risk due to scar tissue.

## Board Pearls & Pitfalls  
- **2nd cleft** = most common (~90%); tract *between ICA/ECA*, *under XII*, *over IX*, to *tonsillar fossa*.  
- **4th cleft** = recurrent left‑sided thyroid/neck abscess with tract to piriform apex.  
- **1st cleft** = parotid/preauricular mass; always consider relation to facial nerve.  
- Never perform definitive excision in acute infection – wait until inflammation resolves.  
- For 3rd/4th clefts: ensure internal opening addressed (endoscopic ligation/cauterization).  
- Adult lateral cystic neck mass = **always consider cystic metastasis** of head & neck SCC until proven otherwise.

### Oral Boards Quick Script  
> “This is a congenital epithelial remnant of a branchial cleft (or sinus/fistula) due to failed involution. After treating any infection, I would plan a definitive excision, via a skin‑crease (or parotid) incision depending on location, carefully identifying and preserving facial nerve (for 1st) or the carotid sheath, CN IX/XII (for 2nd–4th). I will trace the tract to its mucosal origin and ligate/close internal opening when present. Recurrence usually reflects incomplete tract removal or missed internal opening.”
