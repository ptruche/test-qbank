BA001,Biliary Atresia TrueLearn,"A 6-week-old full-term infant presents with persistent jaundice since birth and progressive pale stools over the past 2 weeks. The infant is feeding well, with no vomiting or fever. Physical examination reveals a firm, enlarged liver 3 cm below the right costal margin, and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory studies show elevated conjugated bilirubin, AST, ALT, and GGT levels. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrates a small or absent gallbladder and a triangular echogenic density anterior to the right portal vein. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Choledochal cyst,Alagille syndrome,Neonatal hepatitis,Biliary atresia,Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis,D,"**Correct answer: D — Biliary atresia due to fibro-obliterative extrahepatic cholangiopathy.**

**Correct Answer Explanation:**  
Biliary atresia (BA) is the most common cause of persistent conjugated jaundice in early infancy and the leading indication for pediatric liver transplantation. It results from a progressive fibro-obliterative process of the extrahepatic bile ducts, which leads to bile flow obstruction, cholestasis, and secondary hepatic injury. Most infants are term and appear healthy at birth. The disease typically presents between 2–8 weeks of life with persistent jaundice, pale or acholic stools, and dark urine. Laboratory studies show conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and disproportionately elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT).

Ultrasound findings such as an absent or small gallbladder and the **triangular cord sign**—an echogenic fibrotic remnant anterior to the right portal vein—are highly suggestive of BA. Early recognition is critical, as prompt surgical drainage with the Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy (ideally before 60–90 days of life) can restore bile flow and delay the need for transplant. Delayed diagnosis leads to progressive portal fibrosis, cirrhosis, and end-stage liver failure within 1–2 years.

**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**  
A. *Choledochal cyst* causes cystic dilation of the bile duct and typically shows a fluid-filled structure on imaging rather than an absent gallbladder.  
B. *Alagille syndrome* presents with cholestasis, characteristic facies, posterior embryotoxon, and butterfly vertebrae—not extrahepatic obstruction.  
C. *Neonatal hepatitis* may mimic BA but often shows normal bile ducts and variable GGT; biopsy is essential for differentiation.  
E. *PFIC* involves intrahepatic bile transport defects and presents with normal extrahepatic ducts and very low GGT levels.

**Bottom Line:**  
Biliary atresia presents in the first 2 months of life with conjugated jaundice, acholic stools, and high GGT. Early detection and Kasai surgery before 2–3 months are essential for bile drainage and survival.

**TrueLearn Insight:**  
If you see a well-appearing jaundiced infant with pale stools and dark urine, think biliary atresia—not hepatitis. Remember: elevated GGT and absent gallbladder on ultrasound are diagnostic clues."
BA002,Biliary Atresia TrueLearn,"A 7-week-old infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and acholic stools undergoes a hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA) scan after 5 days of phenobarbital priming. The study shows good hepatic uptake but no tracer excretion into the intestine after 24 hours. Liver biopsy demonstrates bile duct proliferation, bile plugs, and portal fibrosis. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",Start high-dose corticosteroids,Perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP),Refer for Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy,Initiate ursodiol and observe for improvement,Repeat HIDA scan in 7 days,C,"**Correct answer: C — Proceed with Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy.**

**Correct Answer Explanation:**  
The definitive diagnosis of biliary atresia requires demonstration of extrahepatic bile duct obstruction, usually confirmed via operative cholangiography. However, the combination of a non-draining HIDA scan, characteristic liver biopsy findings, and a classic clinical picture makes the diagnosis highly likely. Once confirmed, **prompt surgical drainage via Kasai portoenterostomy** is indicated. Timing is crucial: performing the Kasai before 60–90 days of life significantly improves the chance of bile clearance and prolongs native liver survival.

During the Kasai, the fibrotic extrahepatic ducts are excised to the level of the portal plate, where microscopic bile ductules remain. A Roux-en-Y jejunal limb is anastomosed to this plate to restore bile flow. Postoperatively, children receive ursodiol, fat-soluble vitamins, and prophylactic antibiotics to prevent ascending cholangitis. Despite successful drainage, progressive fibrosis and portal hypertension often occur, and many patients eventually require liver transplantation.

**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**  
A. *High-dose corticosteroids* have not shown long-term benefit in clearing jaundice or improving transplant-free survival (START trial).  
B. *ERCP* is technically difficult in infants and not standard for diagnosis or management.  
D. *Ursodiol alone* is insufficient; surgical drainage is required.  
E. *Repeating HIDA* delays intervention and worsens outcomes.

**Bottom Line:**  
Once biliary atresia is diagnosed or strongly suspected, do not delay—perform a Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy ideally before 8–10 weeks of life.

**TrueLearn Insight:**  
Boards love timing questions: “The single most important prognostic factor for biliary atresia outcome is **age at surgery**.” Think Kasai ≤60 days = best survival."
BA003,Biliary Atresia TrueLearn,"A 2-month-old infant underwent a Kasai portoenterostomy for type III biliary atresia. Over the next 3 months, the infant initially improved but now presents with fever, jaundice, and acholic stools. Laboratory results reveal elevated direct bilirubin and leukocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this presentation?",Portal vein thrombosis,Postoperative bile leak,Ascending cholangitis,Intrahepatic ductal stenosis,Failure of Roux limb anastomosis,C,"**Correct answer: C — Ascending cholangitis following Kasai portoenterostomy.**

**Correct Answer Explanation:**  
Cholangitis is the most common complication after Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy, occurring in up to 60% of patients, often within the first year. It results from **bacterial ascent through the Roux limb** into the intrahepatic biliary system, where stagnant bile promotes infection. Clinically, patients present with recurrent fever, jaundice, and acholic stools. Laboratory findings include leukocytosis and rising direct bilirubin. Without prompt management, cholangitis accelerates hepatic fibrosis and shortens native liver survival.

Management includes broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeting enteric flora, followed by oral prophylaxis (commonly TMP-SMX or amoxicillin–clavulanate) to prevent recurrence. In recurrent cases, evaluation for Roux limb dysfunction, anastomotic stenosis, or intrahepatic obstruction is indicated. Supportive measures such as ursodiol and nutritional optimization are essential for maintaining bile flow and liver health.

**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**  
A. *Portal vein thrombosis* presents with GI bleeding and splenomegaly, not fever and jaundice.  
B. *Bile leak* occurs early postoperatively with bilious drainage or peritonitis.  
D. *Intrahepatic ductal stenosis* contributes to chronic cholestasis but not acute febrile episodes.  
E. *Failure of Roux limb anastomosis* causes persistent jaundice immediately post-op, not delayed recurrence.

**Bottom Line:**  
Recurrent jaundice and fever after Kasai = **ascending cholangitis** until proven otherwise. Treat aggressively to protect native liver function.

**TrueLearn Insight:**  
Remember the rule: *“Acholic stools after initial improvement = cholangitis.”* Always treat with IV antibiotics first, then evaluate anatomy if recurrences persist."
