A 12-year-old girl undergoes oophorectomy for a yolk sac tumor. Postoperative evaluation reveals a small metastatic nodule in a regional lymph node and positive peritoneal cytology. According to the **Children’s Oncology Group (COG)** staging system for ovarian germ cell tumors, what is the appropriate stage of this tumor?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Staging of ovarian germ cell tumors in children** differs significantly from that used for adult ovarian malignancies (which follow the **FIGO system**). Pediatric **germ cell tumors** are classified using the **Children’s Oncology Group (COG) staging system**, which emphasizes **extent of spread, residual disease, and peritoneal cytology**. This staging approach reflects the distinct biology and chemosensitivity of pediatric germ cell tumors.

| **Stage** | **Extent of Disease (COG Definition)** |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| **I** | Tumor **limited to ovary**; peritoneal evaluation **negative**; **no clinical, radiographic, or histologic** evidence of disease beyond ovary. *Gliomatosis peritonei does not upstage disease.* |
| **II** | **Microscopic residual disease**, but peritoneal evaluation remains **negative**. *Gliomatosis peritonei does not alter stage.* |
| **III** | **Lymph node involvement**, **gross residual disease**, **contiguous visceral extension** (omentum, bowel, bladder), or **positive peritoneal cytology**. |
| **IV** | **Distant metastases**, including **liver involvement** or other extraperitoneal sites. |

In this vignette, the presence of **lymph node metastasis** and **positive peritoneal cytology** fulfills **Stage III** criteria under the **COG system**. This system differs fundamentally from **FIGO staging**, which classifies adult epithelial ovarian cancers primarily based on anatomic spread and laterality. Pediatric germ cell tumor staging is instead oriented toward guiding **chemotherapy intensity** and **risk stratification** for survival outcomes.

**Key distinctions from FIGO staging:**
- COG staging does **not upstage disease** for **gliomatosis peritonei**, which is considered biologically benign.  
- COG **Stage I** requires **complete resection** with **negative peritoneal cytology**.  
- COG **Stage III** includes **any positive cytology**, **gross residual**, or **nodal/visceral involvement**, regardless of resectability.  
- **Stage IV** is reserved for **distant (hematogenous)** spread, particularly to the **liver** or **lungs**.

| **Comparison of Pediatric vs. Adult Ovarian Tumor Staging** |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **System** | **Used For** | **Key Distinction** |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------|
| COG | Pediatric germ cell tumors | Focuses on residual disease, nodal spread, and cytology |
| FIGO | Adult epithelial & stromal tumors | Based on anatomic extension and laterality |

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Pediatric germ cell tumors use the **COG**, not FIGO, staging system.  
- **B:** Lymph node involvement is **Stage III**, not II.  
- **C:** Any peritoneal malignancy excludes Stage I classification.  
- **E:** **Gliomatosis peritonei** does *not* alter stage in the COG system.

**Correct answer: D — Stage III disease involves lymph node metastasis, contiguous organ spread, or positive peritoneal cytology.**
