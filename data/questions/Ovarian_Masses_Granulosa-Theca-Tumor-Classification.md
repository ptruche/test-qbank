A 6-year-old girl presents with breast development, vaginal bleeding, and an abdominal mass. Laboratory testing shows elevated estradiol and inhibin with suppressed LH and FSH. Which of the following statements regarding **granulosa-theca cell tumors** is correct?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Granulosa-theca cell tumors (GTCTs)** are the **most common functioning ovarian neoplasm** and belong to the **sex cord-stromal tumor** group. The **juvenile subtype** represents a unique pediatric entity, accounting for nearly half of granulosa cell tumors, with a **median age of 3–7 years**.  

Clinical presentation reflects **hormonal hypersecretion**—most often **estrogen**—resulting in **isosexual pseudoprecocious puberty**, **premature thelarche**, **vaginal bleeding**, and **advanced bone age**. Gonadotropins (LH, FSH) are **suppressed** due to negative feedback, distinguishing these tumors from gonadotropin-secreting or adrenal etiologies.  

**Diagnostic markers** include:  
- **Inhibin A and B** — produced by granulosa cells.  
- **Antimüllerian hormone (AMH)** — also secreted by granulosa cells and helpful for follow-up.  

**Adult granulosa cell tumors** differ histologically and often harbor **FOXL2 mutations**; these are rare in children. Most juvenile lesions are **unilateral** and large (mean 12.5 cm).  

| **Feature** | **Juvenile Granulosa Cell Tumor** |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Median age** | 3–7 years |
| **Hormone secretion** | Estrogen → precocity |
| **Markers** | Inhibin, AMH |
| **Laterality** | Usually unilateral |
| **Mutation** | FOXL2 (adult type) |
| **Treatment** | Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy |

**Correct answer: C — Juvenile granulosa cell tumors are the most common functioning ovarian neoplasm in children, presenting with isosexual pseudoprecocity and elevated estrogen levels.**
