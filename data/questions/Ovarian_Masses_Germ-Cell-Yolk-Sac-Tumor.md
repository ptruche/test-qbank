A 9-year-old girl presents with abdominal distension and pain. Imaging reveals a large, complex ovarian mass. Serum αFP is markedly elevated. What is the most likely diagnosis?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Yolk sac tumors (endodermal sinus tumors)** are the **second most common malignant ovarian germ cell tumors** of childhood, following dysgerminomas. They are **aggressive, rapidly growing** neoplasms that typically present with **pain or distension** due to mass effect or rupture.

**Key diagnostic features:**
- **Marker:** **αFP** is markedly elevated and serves as a **sensitive tumor marker** for diagnosis and monitoring.  
- **Laterality:** Usually **unilateral**.  
- **Age:** Commonly affects **younger girls** (under 10 years).  
- **Metastases:** Spread may involve **peritoneum, liver, lung, and brain**.

| **Characteristic** | **Yolk Sac Tumor** |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Marker | αFP ↑↑ |
| Growth rate | Rapid |
| Metastases | Common (liver, lung, brain) |
| Laterality | Unilateral |
| Prognosis | Excellent with cisplatin-based therapy if localized |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** These tumors are malignant and fast-growing.  
- **C:** They are malignant, not benign.  
- **D:** βhCG is associated with choriocarcinoma.  
- **E:** Bilaterality is rare.

**Correct answer: B — Yolk sac tumors are aggressive ovarian malignancies characterized by αFP elevation.**
