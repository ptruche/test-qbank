correct: D
A: First-line therapy consists of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for three cycles
B: Radiation therapy is the mainstay of treatment for all ovarian germ cell tumors
C: Only Stage IV disease requires chemotherapy; lower stages are observed
D: First-line therapy for Stage II–IV disease is cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin; relapse options include paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and carboplatin
E: Tumor markers are not useful for monitoring treatment response in germ cell tumors

A 15-year-old girl undergoes surgery for a Stage III ovarian yolk sac tumor. Which of the following best summarizes the appropriate **medical management**?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Ovarian germ cell tumors (GCTs)** are highly chemosensitive malignancies. For **Stage II–IV** disease, the standard first-line regimen is **cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEB)**, typically administered for **three to six cycles**.  

After chemotherapy, **tumor markers (αFP, βhCG, LDH)** guide response assessment. If **markers normalize** and there is **no residual disease**, therapy is completed and **surveillance begins**. If **markers remain elevated** or **residual disease persists**, **two to three additional cycles** are given or **second-look surgery** is performed.  

**Salvage therapy** is considered for **relapsed or refractory disease**. Current regimens under investigation include:  
- **Paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and carboplatin (TIP regimen)** — ongoing COG trial.  
- **Ifosfamide plus cisplatin** combinations.  
- **High-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplant.**  
- **Regional deep hyperthermia** and **targeted agents** such as **gemcitabine**, **filgrastim**, and **bevacizumab** in selected refractory cases.  

**Radiation therapy** is reserved for **dysgerminomas**, which are uniquely **radiosensitive**, though chemotherapy remains preferred to preserve fertility.

| **Stage** | **Primary Treatment** | **Response Monitoring** |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| I | Surgery ± marker surveillance | αFP, βhCG |
| II–IV | Cisplatin, etoposide, bleomycin (3–6 cycles) | Tumor markers + imaging |
| Relapse | TIP regimen, HD chemo ± BMT | Marker decline, imaging |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/B/C:** Chemotherapy is indicated for all Stage II–IV disease; radiation is limited to dysgerminomas.  
- **E:** Tumor markers are central to monitoring therapy and detecting relapse.

**Correct answer: D — First-line therapy for Stage II–IV disease is cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin; relapse options include paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and carboplatin.**
