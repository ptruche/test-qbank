A 9-year-old girl presents with intermittent lower abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultrasound reveals a 9 cm cystic adnexal lesion. Which of the following is the most frequent presenting symptom of ovarian tumors in pediatric patients?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **most common presenting symptom of ovarian neoplasms in children** is **abdominal pain**, reported in **over 50% of cases**. Pain may be **acute, subacute, or chronic** depending on the mechanism—**torsion**, **hemorrhage**, or **tumor rupture** may cause acute presentations, while **pressure effects** or **peritoneal irritation** can produce more gradual discomfort. Vomiting is a common associated symptom in torsion or hemorrhagic cysts.

A **palpable abdominal mass** is the next most frequent presenting finding, reported as the **chief complaint in 25% of all pediatric cases** and in **over 50% of children under ten years old**. These masses are typically **mobile** and **palpable above the pelvic brim**, sometimes extending into the abdomen. **Bimanual palpation** may help in detecting smaller lesions, but **vaginal examination** is usually reserved for **sexually active** patients and **not performed in prepubescent girls**.

| **Symptom / Sign** | **Approximate Frequency** | **Mechanism / Cause** |
|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Abdominal pain | >50% | Torsion, rupture, pressure, hemorrhage |
| Palpable mass | 25–50% (more in <10 yrs) | Tumor enlargement, cysts |
| Nausea / vomiting | Common secondary symptom | Torsion, rupture |
| Urinary frequency / urgency | Occasional | Compression of bladder |
| Endocrine changes (virilization / precocity) | 2–16% | Hormone-secreting tumors |

While benign and malignant ovarian lesions can present similarly, several clinical clues suggest a higher likelihood of malignancy:  
- **Age 1–8 years** (3× increased cancer risk)  
- **Tumor diameter >8 cm**  
- **Chief complaint of a mass rather than pain**  

Therefore, a **pain-dominant presentation** is more typical of **benign** lesions (e.g., cysts or torsion), whereas a **mass-dominant presentation** may indicate **malignancy**. Preoperative identification of malignancy remains challenging, with only **36–63%** of cases correctly suspected before surgery.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Acute pain often reflects torsion, not malignancy.  
- **B:** A palpable mass is common but less frequent than pain overall.  
- **D:** Urinary symptoms occur but are secondary.  
- **E:** Vaginal exam is inappropriate for prepubertal children.

**Correct answer: C — Abdominal pain is the most frequent presenting symptom of ovarian tumors in children.**
