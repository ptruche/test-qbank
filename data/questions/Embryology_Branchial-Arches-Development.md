A 6-week-old embryo demonstrates incomplete fusion of the third branchial pouch and cleft. Which of the following structures normally derives from the third branchial arch?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

During the **fourth week of embryologic development**, six pairs of **branchial (pharyngeal) arches** appear on the lateral surface of the developing head and neck. Each arch contains a **cartilaginous core**, **muscular component**, **arterial element**, and a **cranial nerve**. The arches are separated externally by **ectodermal clefts** and internally by **endodermal pouches**. By the **seventh week**, most clefts and pouches (except the first) are obliterated as the second arch grows caudally to form the **cervical sinus of His**.

Understanding the **derivatives of each branchial arch** is fundamental for both embryology and surgical pathology, as anomalies (cysts, sinuses, fistulae) correspond to specific developmental remnants.

### Derivatives of Branchial Arches

| Arch | Artery | Nerve | Muscles | Skeletal Derivatives |
|------|---------|--------|----------|-----------------------|
| **1st (Mandibular)** | Maxillary artery | CN V3 (Trigeminal – mandibular) | Muscles of mastication, mylohyoid, anterior belly of digastric | Meckel cartilage → malleus, incus, mandible |
| **2nd (Hyoid)** | Stapedial artery (regresses) | CN VII (Facial) | Muscles of facial expression, stapedius, posterior belly of digastric | Reichert cartilage → stapes, styloid process, lesser horn of hyoid |
| **3rd** | Common and internal carotid arteries | **CN IX (Glossopharyngeal)** | **Stylopharyngeus** | Greater horn of hyoid |
| **4th** | Aortic arch (left), right subclavian (right) | CN X (Vagus – **superior laryngeal**) | Cricothyroid, levator veli palatini, pharyngeal constrictors | Thyroid cartilage, epiglottis |
| **6th** | Pulmonary arteries, ductus arteriosus (left) | CN X (Vagus – **recurrent laryngeal**) | Intrinsic laryngeal muscles (except cricothyroid) | Cricoid and arytenoid cartilages |

The **third arch** is therefore responsible for forming the **stylopharyngeus muscle**, innervated by **cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal)**, and contributes to the **greater horn of the hyoid bone** as well as the **common and internal carotid arteries**. Its endodermal derivatives include the **inferior parathyroid glands** and **thymus**, which migrate caudally into the anterior mediastinum — a fact relevant to the pathogenesis of **third branchial pouch anomalies** (often presenting as lower neck cysts or sinuses anterior to the sternocleidomastoid).

### Clinical Correlation: Branchial Cleft Anomalies

| Type | Origin | Typical Location | Key Features |
|------|---------|------------------|---------------|
| **First** | 1st cleft | Near external auditory canal or parotid | May involve facial nerve; associated with Meckel cartilage remnants |
| **Second (most common)** | 2nd cleft and pouch | Anterior to SCM, opening near tonsillar fossa | Tracks between internal and external carotid arteries |
| **Third** | **3rd pouch and cleft** | Lower neck, posterior to carotid sheath | Associated with pyriform sinus and thymic migration |
| **Fourth** | 4th pouch | Thyroid region or mediastinum | May present as recurrent left-sided neck abscess in children |

**Key concept:** Failure of obliteration of the clefts and pouches results in cysts (closed spaces), sinuses (communication with skin or mucosa), or fistulae (communication between both). The **second cleft anomaly** is the most common; **third and fourth** are rarer and often misdiagnosed.

**Distractor reasoning:**
- **A (First arch)** – Associated with Meckel cartilage and muscles of mastication (CN V3), not stylopharyngeus.  
- **B (Second arch)** – Forms facial structures and muscles (CN VII), not parathyroids or carotids.  
- **D (Fourth arch)** – Associated with vagus/superior laryngeal nerve and laryngeal structures.  
- **E (Sixth arch)** – Derives laryngeal cartilage and recurrent laryngeal nerve musculature.

**Correct answer: C — The third branchial arch gives rise to the stylopharyngeus muscle, glossopharyngeal nerve, and inferior parathyroid glands.**
