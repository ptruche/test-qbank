A 6-year-old girl presents with abdominal distension and an adnexal mass discovered on ultrasound. Serum tumor markers are pending. Her mother asks about the likelihood that the mass is cancerous compared with an older adolescent. Which of the following statements best characterizes the age-related malignancy risk of ovarian tumors in pediatric patients?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **age-specific risk of ovarian malignancy** in pediatric patients follows a nuanced pattern that differs from adults. Although **ovarian tumors overall become more common with age**, the **proportion that are malignant** is actually **higher in prepubescent girls** than in adolescents.

Epidemiologic studies, including SEER registry data, have shown that the **incidence of malignant ovarian tumors** in those **under 9 years old** is approximately **0.1 per 100,000**, compared with **1.0 per 100,000** in those aged 10–19 years. However, among neoplastic ovarian lesions, **22% of prepubertal tumors (ages 1–8)** are malignant compared to **only 10% in adolescents (≥9 years)**. Thus, while the absolute number of tumors rises with age, **the likelihood that a given ovarian mass is malignant is higher in younger children**.

| Age Group | Approximate Malignancy Rate (%) | Typical Pathology | Key Notes |
|------------|-------------------------------:|-------------------|------------|
| <1 year | Extremely rare | Rare germ cell tumors | Malignancy uncommon |
| 1–8 years (prepubescent) | ~22% | Germ cell tumors predominate | Highest malignant proportion |
| 9–19 years (adolescent) | ~10% | Germ cell tumors still majority | Incidence rises, malignancy proportion falls |
| Adults | Much higher incidence overall | Epithelial tumors dominate | Often widely metastatic at presentation |

**Pathologic patterns** differ dramatically by age. In **children and adolescents**, **germ cell tumors** constitute approximately **75% of neoplastic ovarian lesions**, compared with **20% in adults**. Conversely, **epithelial ovarian tumors**, which are common and aggressive in adults, are **rare in those under 20 years**. This distinction explains why **prognosis in pediatric ovarian malignancy is generally favorable**, as germ cell tumors are often localized and respond well to surgical resection and chemotherapy.

The **etiologic syndromes** associated with ovarian tumors also vary by tumor type:
- **DICER1 syndrome:** Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors  
- **Peutz-Jeghers syndrome:** Granulosa cell and sex cord–stromal tumors with annular tubules  
- **Ollier and Maffucci syndromes:** Juvenile granulosa and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors  
- **McCune-Albright syndrome:** Recurrent cystic ovarian lesions causing precocious puberty  
- **Basal cell nevus syndrome:** Ovarian fibromas  

These syndromes are uncommon but clinically important, particularly when ovarian lesions occur at atypical ages or with syndromic features.

| Syndrome | Associated Ovarian Lesions |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| DICER1 | Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor |
| Peutz-Jeghers | Granulosa cell, cystadenoma |
| Ollier / Maffucci | Juvenile granulosa, Sertoli-Leydig |
| McCune-Albright | Recurrent follicular cysts |
| Basal cell nevus | Fibromas |

In summary, **prepubescent girls have a higher proportion of malignant ovarian tumors compared with adolescents**, even though adolescents develop more ovarian tumors overall. Awareness of this counterintuitive relationship is critical for surgical decision-making and counseling.

**Correct answer: D — Prepubescent girls have a higher proportion of malignant ovarian tumors than adolescents.**
