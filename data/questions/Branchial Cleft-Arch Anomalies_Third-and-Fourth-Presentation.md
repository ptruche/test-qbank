A 10-year-old girl presents with her third episode of left-sided neck swelling and pain over the past year. Each episode has been preceded by an upper respiratory infection and has required incision and drainage of a deep neck abscess. On this occasion, CT reveals a rim-enhancing lesion extending into the thyroid gland. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of her recurrent infections?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Third and fourth branchial cleft anomalies** are rare developmental remnants that can present in childhood or even adulthood, often after repeated episodes of **neck infections, abscesses, or suppurative thyroiditis**. These lesions are frequently overlooked, as early infections are treated without recognition of the underlying congenital tract.

**Clinical presentation:**  
Patients typically present with **recurrent deep neck infections**, **abscesses**, or **thyroid involvement**. **Suppurative thyroiditis**—especially on the left side—is a classic presentation of a **fourth branchial cleft anomaly**, as the tract often passes near or through the thyroid gland before entering the **pyriform sinus**. Infections may be precipitated by **upper respiratory infections**, and sudden enlargement due to **superinfection** can cause **airway compromise, torticollis, or dysphagia**.

**Age at presentation:**  
While **sinuses and fistulae** tend to present in **infancy or early childhood**, isolated **cysts** are more often identified in **older children or adults** when infection or inflammation leads to sudden enlargement. These lesions may remain **clinically silent for years** until infection occurs.

| **Feature** | **Third Branchial Cleft** | **Fourth Branchial Cleft** |
|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Course** | Posterior to internal carotid artery; enters pyriform sinus above superior laryngeal nerve | Passes below superior laryngeal nerve; may traverse or abut thyroid gland | 
| **Typical Presentation** | Recurrent lower neck abscess or cyst | Left-sided suppurative thyroiditis; recurrent neck infections |
| **Internal Opening** | Pyriform sinus (above SLN) | Pyriform sinus (below SLN) |
| **Side Predilection** | Either side | Usually left |
| **Key Complication** | Airway compromise, torticollis, dysphagia | Infection extending into thyroid or mediastinum |

**Diagnosis:**  
Suspicion should arise with **recurrent deep neck infections**, especially when involving the **thyroid gland** or the **left lower neck**. **Barium swallow** or **contrast-enhanced CT/MRI** may identify a **tract from the pyriform sinus**. **Direct laryngoscopy** may demonstrate an internal sinus opening at the apex of the pyriform sinus.

**Management:**  
Initial treatment addresses infection with **antibiotics and drainage** if necessary, but **definitive management requires surgical excision** or **endoscopic cauterization** of the **sinus tract’s internal opening** to prevent recurrence.

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** First branchial cleft anomalies involve the parotid region and external auditory canal, not the thyroid.  
- **B:** Second branchial cleft cysts are typically located anterior to the SCM and rarely cause airway compromise.  
- **C:** Fourth branchial cleft cysts cause thyroid infections, not otorrhea.  
- **E:** Many cysts present later in childhood or adulthood, not neonatally.

**Correct answer: D — Third and fourth branchial cleft anomalies commonly present with recurrent neck infections or suppurative thyroiditis, often triggered by upper respiratory infections.**
