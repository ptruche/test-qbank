id: BCA-010
subject: Branchial Cleft/Arch Anomalies
correct: C
A: Recurrence after complete excision of a branchial cleft anomaly is rare (<1%) and not influenced by infection.
B: Nerve injuries are uncommon in branchial cleft surgery because the tracts lie superficial to major neurovascular structures.
C: Infection and recurrence are the most common complications, with nerve injury risk varying by anomaly type and surgical difficulty.
D: The most frequent nerve injured during resection of first branchial cleft anomalies is the hypoglossal nerve.
E: Recurrence is more common after primary excision than after revision surgery.

A 6-year-old girl presents for excision of a recurrent preauricular cyst previously treated with two unsuccessful operations elsewhere. At surgery, the cyst is noted to course through the parotid gland. Postoperatively, she develops weakness of the lower facial muscles. Which of the following statements best summarizes the complications associated with branchial cleft anomaly surgery?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Complications** following surgery for branchial cleft anomalies depend on the **type of anomaly**, the **extent of infection**, and whether **prior surgeries** have been performed. Because of diagnostic uncertainty, **25–50% of patients** have undergone previous procedures before a correct diagnosis and complete resection.

### **Most Common Complications**
The most frequent complications are **infection** and **recurrence**:
- **Infection:** 5–10% overall
- **Recurrence:** 2–12% after surgery
- **Recurrence when infected at time of resection:** up to **20%**

Infection and inflammation obscure tissue planes and make it difficult to identify and excise the entire epithelial tract, increasing the risk of recurrence. Operating only after inflammation has resolved markedly reduces complications.

### **Nerve Injury Risk**
The risk of **nerve injury** varies with the lesion’s location and the nerves in proximity to its tract. Reported rates and key structures include:

| **Branchial Type** | **Nerves at Risk** | **Reported Nerve Injury Rate** |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| **First** | Facial nerve (esp. marginal mandibular branch) | 10–40% |
| **Second** | Hypoglossal, glossopharyngeal, marginal mandibular | Low |
| **Third** | Superior and recurrent laryngeal | Rare but serious |
| **Fourth** | Recurrent laryngeal, superior laryngeal | Rare |

- **Facial nerve injury** is the most significant risk during **first branchial cleft anomaly resection**, given the tract’s frequent course through or medial to the **parotid gland**.  
- Incomplete prior surgeries increase the risk of **nerve injury**, **hematoma**, **salivary fistula**, and **recurrence** due to **scarring** and distorted anatomy.

### **Other Reported Complications**
- **Salivary fistula**, **hematoma**, or **seroma**  
- **Injury to tympanic membrane** or **external auditory canal** (especially in Type I first cleft anomalies)  
- **Hypertrophic or keloid scarring**, particularly after repeated surgery  

**Preventive measures:**  
- Delay definitive resection until infection has resolved.  
- Identify and preserve cranial nerves during dissection.  
- Avoid incision and drainage when possible; prefer aspiration.  

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** Recurrence rates are 2–12%, not <1%, and infection increases recurrence risk.  
- **B:** Nerve injuries are relatively common, especially in first cleft anomalies.  
- **D:** The **facial nerve**, not the hypoglossal, is most often injured in first cleft cases.  
- **E:** Recurrence is more likely after **incomplete or infected excision**, not after the primary clean resection.

**Correct answer: C — Infection and recurrence are the most common complications, and nerve injury risk depends on the anomaly type and surgical complexity.**
