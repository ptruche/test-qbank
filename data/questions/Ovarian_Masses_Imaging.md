A 13-year-old girl presents with progressive lower abdominal fullness and intermittent pain. On physical examination, a mobile mass is palpable above the pelvic brim. The surgical team orders imaging to guide operative planning and risk assessment. What is the most appropriate **first-line imaging study** for evaluating this patient?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Ultrasound (US)** remains the cornerstone of initial imaging for suspected ovarian lesions in children and adolescents. It is noninvasive, free of ionizing radiation, and provides detailed information on cystic versus solid composition, wall regularity, and the presence of mural nodules or septations. For optimal visualization, the **urinary bladder must be distended**, which displaces gas-filled bowel loops and enhances sound wave transmission to the pelvis. US can reveal features strongly suggestive o...

When US findings are indeterminate, **MRI** or **CT** may be used to further evaluate mass extent, organ invasion, or metastatic disease. MRI is particularly valuable in patients with obesity or when delineating soft tissue contrast between adnexal structures. CT is reserved for staging confirmed malignancies, and **chest CT** specifically evaluates for pulmonary metastases. **PET-CT** is rarely used, limited to cases of suspected recurrence with negative conventional imaging but rising tumor markers.

| **Imaging Modality** | **Best Use** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-----------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Ultrasound** | First-line for all ovarian lesions | Radiation-free, dynamic, portable | Operator dependent, limited depth |
| **MRI** | Clarify soft tissue extent and organ invasion | Excellent contrast, no radiation | Longer, expensive |
| **CT** | Staging known malignant lesions | High spatial resolution | Radiation exposure |
| **PET-CT** | Evaluate recurrence with rising markers | Detects metabolically active disease | Not for initial evaluation |

Beyond diagnosis, imaging findings directly influence **operative planning**. Complex, heterogeneous, or irregular masses often require an open approach to prevent rupture, which would **upstage disease and necessitate chemotherapy**. Conversely, large benign cysts or mature teratomas may be managed laparoscopically with ovarian-sparing intent. This balance underscores the importance of **multidisciplinary evaluation** among pediatric surgery, oncology, gynecology, pathology, and radiology teams.

**Correct answer: D — Ultrasound with adequate bladder distention is the first-line imaging modality for evaluating pediatric ovarian lesions.**
