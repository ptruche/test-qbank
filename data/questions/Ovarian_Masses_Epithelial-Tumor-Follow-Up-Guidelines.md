id: OM-026
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: B
A: Routine CA-125 measurement during follow-up has been shown to improve survival outcomes
B: Regular clinical follow-up every 3–4 months for 2 years with selective imaging is recommended, while routine CA-125 surveillance offers limited survival benefit
C: Imaging studies should be performed monthly for the first year after surgery
D: All patients should undergo routine CT scans every 3 months regardless of stage
E: Serum CA-125 levels are no longer used in follow-up after epithelial ovarian cancer treatment

A 17-year-old adolescent has undergone oophorectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IIIC epithelial ovarian carcinoma. She asks about her follow-up plan. Which of the following best describes the recommended follow-up approach?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Follow-up for epithelial ovarian tumors** in adolescents generally follows adult oncology guidelines, though the evidence base in pediatrics is limited. The goals are to **detect recurrence early**, monitor for **treatment-related effects**, and **preserve long-term reproductive and endocrine health**.

**Recommended follow-up schedule:**
- **Clinical evaluation** every **3–4 months for the first 2 years**, then **every 6 months for 3–5 years**, including history, physical examination, and pelvic assessment.  
- **Imaging studies** are performed **as clinically indicated** based on symptoms or concerning findings rather than on a fixed schedule.  
- **Serum CA-125 levels** may be monitored in patients with previously elevated markers, but their **routine use remains controversial**.

A **Cochrane review** of randomized data found **no improvement in survival** among patients treated earlier for recurrence based solely on **rising CA-125** versus those treated upon **clinical recurrence**. Therefore, routine CA-125 testing is **not mandatory** and should be **individualized**. Clinical evaluation and symptom-guided imaging remain the cornerstones of surveillance.

| **Follow-up Element** | **Typical Frequency** | **Notes** |
|------------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Clinical visit | Every 3–4 mo × 2 yrs, then q6 mo | Focus on recurrence, fertility issues |
| Imaging | As indicated | CT/MRI based on findings |
| CA-125 | Optional | Limited survival benefit |

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Early treatment based on CA-125 does **not** improve survival.  
- **C/D:** Routine or monthly imaging is unnecessary and increases cost and radiation exposure.  
- **E:** CA-125 may still be useful in selected cases but is not obligatory.

**Correct answer: B — Regular clinical follow-up every 3–4 months for 2 years with selective imaging is recommended, while routine CA-125 surveillance offers limited survival benefit.**
