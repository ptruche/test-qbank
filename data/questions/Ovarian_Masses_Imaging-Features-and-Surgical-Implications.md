id: OM-013
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: D
A: A cystic lesion larger than 5 cm is always malignant
B: Calcifications always indicate a malignant germ cell tumor
C: Simple cysts with smooth walls and homogeneous appearance are worrisome for malignancy
D: Complex solid or heterogeneous masses with irregular borders, necrosis, or ascites raise suspicion for malignancy
E: All large ovarian cysts should be managed with open salpingo-oophorectomy

A 10-year-old girl presents with an 11 cm heterogeneous ovarian mass with irregular margins and internal septations on ultrasound. There is free intraperitoneal fluid. Which of the following imaging findings is most concerning for malignancy?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Imaging characteristics** are crucial in differentiating **benign** from **malignant ovarian lesions** and guiding **surgical planning**. While definitive diagnosis depends on histopathology, certain sonographic and cross-sectional imaging features reliably suggest malignant potential.

**Features suggesting a benign lesion:**
- **Simple cysts** with **thin, smooth walls**
- **Homogeneous**, anechoic appearance
- **Peripheral echogenic nodules** with **acoustic shadowing** (e.g., mature teratoma)

**Features concerning for malignancy:**
- **Complex or solid lesions**
- **Irregular, ill-defined borders**
- **Heterogeneous echotexture**
- **Central necrosis**
- **Papillary projections or thick septations**
- **Ascites** or **iliac chain lymphadenopathy**  

| **Feature** | **Benign Appearance** | **Malignant Appearance** |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Wall contour | Thin, smooth | Irregular, thickened |
| Internal structure | Simple cystic | Solid or mixed solid-cystic |
| Septations | Absent or thin | Thick with nodularity |
| Border definition | Well circumscribed | Poorly defined, infiltrative |
| Associated findings | None | Ascites, nodal enlargement |

**Size** also contributes to preoperative risk assessment. While benign cysts may be large (>20 cm), **solid or complex lesions ≥8 cm** warrant concern for malignancy. Thus, **size should always be interpreted with morphologic features** rather than used in isolation.

**Surgical implications:**  
- **Benign-appearing lesions**: managed with **ovarian-sparing resection**, ideally minimally invasive.  
- **Suspicious lesions**: require **open exploration** to avoid rupture and potential **upstaging**.  
- **Multidisciplinary evaluation** (surgery, oncology, gynecology, radiology) ensures optimal management and fertility preservation when feasible.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Size alone does not define malignancy.  
- **B:** Calcification is often a sign of mature (benign) teratoma.  
- **C:** Simple cysts are benign findings.  
- **E:** Many cysts are benign and suitable for ovarian-sparing surgery.

**Correct answer: D — Complex solid or heterogeneous masses with irregular borders, necrosis, or ascites raise suspicion for malignancy.**
