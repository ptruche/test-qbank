id: OM-051
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: C
A: Relapse of juvenile granulosa cell tumors typically occurs more than 10 years after diagnosis
B: Chest CT should be performed every three months to screen for intrathoracic recurrence in all patients
C: Long-term follow-up with serial pelvic MRI or ultrasound every three months for the first three years is recommended, with extended surveillance for certain subtypes
D: Alpha-fetoprotein is not a useful marker for monitoring recurrence in any sex cord-stromal tumor
E: CT imaging is preferred over ultrasound for all patients to ensure sensitivity

A 12-year-old girl undergoes unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for a juvenile granulosa cell tumor. Postoperatively, her tumor markers normalize. Which of the following follow-up strategies is most appropriate?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Long-term follow-up** is essential after treatment of **sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs)** because up to **10% of patients develop contralateral recurrence**, sometimes years after initial therapy. Follow-up strategies should balance **oncologic surveillance** with **minimization of radiation exposure**, particularly in pediatric and adolescent patients.

**Preferred imaging modalities:**  
- **Ultrasound (US)** and **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** are the modalities of choice for ongoing surveillance.  
- **CT scans** are avoided when possible due to radiation exposure, except in complex or unclear cases.  
- Usual recommendation: **every 3 months for the first 3 years**, then progressively longer intervals (e.g., every 6–12 months).  

**Tumor markers:**  
- Should be monitored at each follow-up if they were elevated at diagnosis.  
- **Inhibin B** and **CA-125** are most commonly used.  
- **α-fetoprotein (AFP)** should be monitored in patients whose tumors expressed it initially.  
- **Hormonal markers** (estradiol, testosterone) may also be followed if elevated preoperatively.  

**Recurrence patterns:**  
- **Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors**: Recurrence typically occurs within the **first few years**.  
- **Juvenile granulosa cell tumors**: Most relapse within the same period, though **adult granulosa cell tumors** may recur **>10 years later**, requiring **prolonged follow-up**.  
- **DICER1-associated tumors**: Require extended surveillance due to risk of additional malignancies (e.g., thyroid, pleuropulmonary blastoma).  
- **Intrathoracic relapse** is rare without prior **abdominopelvic recurrence**.  

| **Follow-Up Component** | **Recommendation** |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
| **Imaging** | MRI or US every 3 months × 3 years, then less frequent |
| **Tumor markers** | Inhibin B, CA-125, hormonal markers, ± AFP |
| **Duration** | ≥3 years, longer for adult granulosa or DICER1 variants |
| **Relapse risk** | 10%, usually early; contralateral ovary common site |

**Incorrect answers:**  
- **A:** Juvenile, not adult, granulosa tumors recur early.  
- **B:** Intrathoracic relapse is rare; chest CT is not routinely indicated.  
- **D:** AFP is valuable when initially elevated.  
- **E:** MRI/US are preferred due to radiation concerns.

**Correct answer: C — Long-term follow-up with serial pelvic MRI or ultrasound every three months for the first three years is recommended, with extended surveillance for certain subtypes.**
