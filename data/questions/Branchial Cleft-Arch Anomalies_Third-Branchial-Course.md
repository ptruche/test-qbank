id: BCA-005
subject: Branchial Cleft/Arch Anomalies
correct: D
A: Third branchial cleft anomalies most often occur on the right and pass anterior to the internal carotid artery.
B: The tract of a third branchial cleft anomaly passes inferior to the superior laryngeal nerve and enters the tonsillar fossa.
C: Second branchial cleft anomalies course posterior to the internal carotid artery and deep to the glossopharyngeal nerve.
D: Third branchial cleft anomalies are more common on the left, course posterior to the internal carotid artery, and enter the pyriform sinus above the superior laryngeal nerve.
E: Fourth branchial cleft anomalies pass cephalad to the superior laryngeal nerve and end in the external auditory canal.

A 5-year-old boy presents with a recurrently infected cystic lesion in the lower left neck along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. During surgical exploration, the tract is found to extend posterior to the internal carotid artery, deep to the glossopharyngeal nerve, and superior to the hypoglossal nerve before piercing the apex of the pyriform sinus. Which of the following best characterizes this anomaly?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Third branchial cleft anomalies** are uncommon developmental remnants of the **third branchial pouch and cleft**. They account for only a small fraction of all branchial anomalies and are often **misidentified as second branchial cleft cysts** until their **surgical anatomy** is determined. These lesions are **more common on the left side** and can present in childhood with recurrent neck infections or abscesses.

### **Anatomic Course**
The classic course of a **complete third branchial fistula** is as follows:

1. **External opening** near the **anterior border of the lower sternocleidomastoid** (at or below the thyroid cartilage).  
2. The tract ascends **posterior to the internal carotid artery**.  
3. It passes **deep to the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)** and **superior to the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)**.  
4. It courses **cephalad to the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN)**—a key distinction from **fourth branchial anomalies**, which pass **caudad** to the SLN.  
5. The tract then pierces the **thyrohyoid membrane** and enters the **apex of the pyriform sinus**.  

| **Feature** | **Third Branchial Cleft Anomaly** | **Fourth Branchial Cleft Anomaly** |
|--------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Side predilection** | More common on **left** | Predominantly **left** |
| **Course relative to ICA** | **Posterior** | **Medial or parallel** |
| **Course relative to SLN** | **Above (cephalad)** | **Below (caudad)** |
| **Internal opening** | **Pyriform sinus (above SLN)** | **Pyriform sinus (below SLN)** |
| **Key structures nearby** | CN IX, CN X, CN XII, carotid sheath, thyroid gland | Thyroid gland, RLN, inferior thyroid artery |
| **Typical presentation** | Recurrent lower neck abscess or **suppurative thyroiditis** | Left-sided **recurrent thyroiditis or abscess** |

**Clinical features:**  
Third branchial anomalies may present as **cysts**, **sinuses**, or **complete fistulae**. The external component is typically located at the **lower anterior or posterior border of the SCM**, while the internal tract terminates in the **pyriform sinus**. Because of its proximity to the **thyroid gland**, **acute suppurative thyroiditis in a child** should raise suspicion for a **third branchial remnant**.

**Surgical considerations:**  
During excision, the surgeon must carefully identify and protect the **glossopharyngeal (CN IX)**, **hypoglossal (CN XII)**, **vagus (CN X)**, and **superior laryngeal nerves**, as well as the **carotid artery** and **thyroid gland**. **Complete tract excision** is necessary to prevent recurrence.

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** Third branchial anomalies are more often **left-sided** and pass **posterior**, not anterior, to the ICA.  
- **B:** The tract enters the **pyriform sinus above**, not below, the SLN and does **not** reach the tonsillar fossa.  
- **C:** The description fits a **third**, not a second, branchial anomaly.  
- **E:** Fourth branchial anomalies pass **below** the SLN and enter the pyriform sinus, not the EAC.

**Correct answer: D — Third branchial cleft anomalies are more common on the left, course posterior to the internal carotid artery, and enter the pyriform sinus above the superior laryngeal nerve.**
