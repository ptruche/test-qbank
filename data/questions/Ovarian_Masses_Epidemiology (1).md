A 14-year-old girl presents with a slowly enlarging abdominal mass and intermittent lower abdominal pain. Ultrasound reveals a 9-cm complex ovarian mass with both solid and cystic components. Laboratory studies demonstrate elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The patient undergoes unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pathology confirms an immature teratoma. Which of the following statements best characterizes the epidemiology of ovarian neoplasms in pediatric patients?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Ovarian neoplasms are the most common gynecologic tumors in females under 20 years of age, with an incidence of approximately 5 per 100,000 per year. About half of all pediatric ovarian masses are neoplastic, and the remainder are functional cysts. Among the neoplastic lesions, roughly 75% are of germ cell origin, a proportion that contrasts sharply with adults, where germ cell tumors represent only about 20% of ovarian neoplasms and epithelial tumors predominate. The overall malignancy rate in pediatric ovarian neoplasms is low, ranging between 10% and 20%, but varies significantly by age group. Infants rarely develop malignant ovarian tumors, whereas prepubertal girls (ages 1–8 years) have a higher rate of malignancy (approximately 22%) compared with adolescents (around 10%).

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database shows that the age-adjusted incidence of malignant ovarian tumors is 0.1 per 100,000 in girls younger than 9 years versus 1.1 per 100,000 in those aged 10–19 years—still an order of magnitude lower than adults, whose incidence is approximately 11 per 100,000 annually. These data underscore that while ovarian neoplasms become more common with age, the proportion that are malignant decreases after puberty. This reflects a shift from predominantly germ cell and sex cord–stromal tumors in children to epithelial tumors in adults.

Several syndromic associations are worth noting for pediatric surgeons. DICER1 syndrome predisposes to Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors; Peutz-Jeghers syndrome to granulosa cell and sex cord–stromal tumors; Ollier and Maffucci syndromes to juvenile granulosa and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors; and McCune-Albright syndrome to recurrent benign follicular cysts due to autonomous estradiol secretion. Recognizing these patterns can help guide surveillance and operative planning.

Incorrect options:  
- **A** is incorrect because germ cell tumors account for about 75%, not 20%, of pediatric ovarian neoplasms.  
- **C** is incorrect because epithelial tumors are exceedingly rare in children, particularly under 10 years old.  
- **D** is incorrect because ovarian malignancy is far more common in adults than adolescents.  
- **E** is incorrect because the prognosis of pediatric ovarian malignancies is generally better than in adults, reflecting differences in histologic subtypes and stage at presentation.

**Correct answer: B — Germ cell tumors constitute approximately 75% of pediatric ovarian neoplasms.**
