id: OM-006A
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: D
A: Preoperative evaluation is unnecessary if imaging is strongly suggestive of a benign lesion
B: Tumor markers have poor reliability in the assessment of pediatric ovarian masses
C: Elevated CA-125 is specific for epithelial ovarian malignancy in children
D: Comprehensive laboratory evaluation, including AFP, β-hCG, LDH, and inhibins, is essential for risk stratification
E: LDH is rarely elevated in malignant pediatric ovarian tumors

A 13-year-old girl presents with a 10 cm complex adnexal mass identified on ultrasound. She is afebrile and denies acute pain. The surgical team plans her operation and discusses the appropriate preoperative workup. Which of the following best describes the recommended laboratory assessment?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Preoperative evaluation of ovarian masses in pediatric and adolescent patients requires both **tumor markers and imaging** for accurate **risk stratification** and optimal **surgical planning**. The goal is to maximize ovarian preservation for benign lesions while ensuring appropriate staging and resection for malignancy. The recommended **tumor markers** include **lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**, **β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)**, **alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)**, **CA-125**, **CA 19-9**, **CEA**, **estr...

| **Marker** | **Commonly Associated Tumor Type** | **Key Notes** |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| LDH | Dysgerminoma | Elevated in 98% of malignant cases |
| β-hCG | Choriocarcinoma, dysgerminoma | May also be elevated in pregnancy or trophoblastic tissue |
| AFP | Yolk sac tumor | Highly specific for malignant germ cell tumors |
| Inhibin A/B | Granulosa cell tumor | Reflects estrogenic activity |
| CA-125 / CEA | Epithelial or inflammatory lesions | Non-specific; mild elevation in benign disease |

**Correct answer: D — Comprehensive laboratory evaluation, including AFP, β-hCG, LDH, and inhibins, is essential for risk stratification.**
