id: OM-045
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: C
A: Gynandroblastomas are the most common type of sex cord-stromal tumor
B: These tumors contain both germ cell and epithelial elements
C: Gynandroblastomas contain both granulosa cell and Sertoli-Leydig components, often occur in adolescents, and may be associated with DICER1 mutations
D: Most patients present with advanced-stage disease and poor outcomes
E: They are uniformly estrogen-producing and cause precocious puberty

A 16-year-old girl presents with a unilateral ovarian mass. Pathology reveals elements of both granulosa cell and Sertoli-Leydig cell differentiation. Genetic sequencing identifies a DICER1 mutation. Which of the following statements best characterizes this tumor?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Gynandroblastomas** are **rare mixed sex cord-stromal tumors** composed of **both granulosa (feminizing)** and **Sertoli-Leydig (virilizing)** cell components. They are classified as **sex cord-stromal tumors of mixed forms** and account for approximately **5% of sex cord-stromal tumors**.  

These tumors can occur across a wide age range but most frequently present in **adolescents**. The **International Ovarian and Testicular Stromal Tumor Registry** reported a **median age of 16 years** among five identified cases, four of which were **Stage Ia**, all with excellent outcomes and **no recurrence** at follow-up.  

**Genetic associations:**  
- **DICER1 mutations** are present in a significant proportion (identified in 3 of 4 sequenced patients).  
- Given this, **genetic counseling and screening** for other DICER1-associated tumors (e.g., pleuropulmonary blastoma, thyroid carcinoma) are recommended.

| **Feature** | **Gynandroblastoma** |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Composition** | Granulosa + Sertoli-Leydig elements |
| **Incidence** | ~5% of sex cord-stromal tumors |
| **Median age** | 16 years |
| **Stage at diagnosis** | Usually Stage Ia |
| **Mutation** | DICER1 in majority |
| **Prognosis** | Excellent; all alive without disease |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/B:** These tumors are rare and contain **sex cord** elements, not germ or epithelial.  
- **D:** Most are **low-stage** with favorable outcomes.  
- **E:** They may produce either **androgens or estrogens**, depending on the dominant cell type.

**Correct answer: C â€” Gynandroblastomas contain both granulosa cell and Sertoli-Leydig components, often occur in adolescents, and may be associated with DICER1 mutations.**
