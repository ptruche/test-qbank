A 6-year-old girl presents with rapid breast development and vaginal bleeding. Physical examination reveals an abdominal mass. Serum estradiol is elevated. Which of the following best explains this presentation?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Endocrine activity** occurs in **2–16% of girls** with ovarian neoplasms. Hormone-producing tumors can lead to **precocious puberty**, **pseudopuberty**, or **virilization**, depending on the secreted hormone. Endocrine symptoms are particularly important because **50–60% of hormonally active tumors are malignant**.

**Precocious puberty** is most commonly caused by **sex cord–stromal tumors**, especially **juvenile granulosa cell tumors** and some **Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors**, which secrete **estrogen**. These cause **gonadotropin-independent sexual precocity** (pseudopuberty).  
**Precocious pseudopuberty** can also occur in **germ cell tumors** (dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, or choriocarcinoma) that produce **human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)**.

**Virilization** results from androgen-producing tumors such as **Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors**, **dysgerminomas with syncytial trophoblastic giant cells**, or **yolk sac tumors**. These patients may develop **clitoromegaly**, **deepened voice**, or **hirsutism**.

| **Endocrine Presentation** | **Likely Tumor Type** | **Predominant Hormone** |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Precocious puberty | Juvenile granulosa cell, Sertoli-Leydig | Estrogen |
| Precocious pseudopuberty | Germ cell (dysgerminoma, yolk sac, choriocarcinoma) | hCG |
| Virilization | Sertoli-Leydig, dysgerminoma, yolk sac | Testosterone / Androgens |

**Atypical presentations** include **paraneoplastic syndromes** (e.g., **limbic encephalitis** with seizures and behavioral changes) and **hypercalcemia**, which can occur in **germ cell tumors** or **small cell carcinoma of the ovary**. Rarely, **struma ovarii**, a teratoma composed mostly of thyroid tissue, may cause **thyrotoxicosis**.

Recognition of these patterns is vital for accurate diagnosis and surgical planning, especially since hormonal findings may precede detection of the mass itself.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Endocrine activity occurs in up to 16%, not <1%.  
- **C:** Virilization is seen in multiple tumor types, not just dysgerminoma.  
- **D:** Germ cell tumors producing hCG can cause precocity.  
- **E:** Paraneoplastic phenomena, while rare, do occur.

**Correct answer: B — Precocious puberty due to estrogen secretion is most commonly caused by sex cord–stromal tumors.**
