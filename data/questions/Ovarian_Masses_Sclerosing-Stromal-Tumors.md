id: OM-047
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: D
A: Sclerosing stromal tumors are malignant and typically bilateral
B: These tumors are usually androgen-secreting and require chemotherapy
C: They are indistinguishable from fibromas and thecomas both histologically and clinically
D: Sclerosing stromal tumors are benign, often unilateral, occur in young women, and are treated with gross tumor excision
E: Chediak-Higashi syndrome is unrelated to ovarian neoplasia

A 19-year-old woman presents with pelvic pain, irregular menses, and a unilateral 6-cm solid ovarian mass on imaging. Serum hormone studies show mildly elevated estrogen levels. Pathology reveals a pseudolobulated pattern with alternating cellular and collagenous areas. Which of the following statements best describes this lesion?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Sclerosing stromal tumors (SSTs)** are **rare benign sex cord–stromal tumors** that are now recognized as a distinct pathologic entity, separate from **fibromas** and **thecomas**. Approximately **30% occur in the first two decades of life**, making them one of the few hormonally active ovarian tumors found in adolescents.  

**Clinical presentation:**  
- Pelvic pain and **menstrual irregularities** are the most common symptoms.  
- **Estrogen secretion** may occasionally occur, whereas **androgen manifestations** are **rare**.  
- These tumors are **unilateral**, **benign**, and typically **>5 cm** in diameter.  
- **Chediak-Higashi syndrome** has been associated with SSTs.  

**Histologic features:**  
- **Pseudolobulated pattern** with cellular nodules sharply demarcated from **edematous and collagenized areas**.  
- Abundant vasculature and a distinctive pattern on microscopy help differentiate them from fibromas and thecomas.  

**Management:**  
- **Gross tumor excision** is curative; recurrence and malignant transformation are exceedingly rare.  
- Fertility-sparing surgery is appropriate given the benign nature of the tumor.

| **Feature** | **Sclerosing Stromal Tumor** |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **Age group** | Adolescents, young adults |
| **Hormone activity** | Occasionally estrogenic |
| **Association** | Chediak-Higashi syndrome |
| **Laterality** | Unilateral |
| **Histology** | Pseudolobulated, cellular + edematous zones |
| **Treatment** | Gross excision (benign) |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/B/C:** SSTs are benign, unilateral, and histologically distinct from other stromal tumors.  
- **E:** Chediak-Higashi syndrome is indeed associated with SSTs.

**Correct answer: D — Sclerosing stromal tumors are benign, often unilateral, occur in young women, and are treated with gross tumor excision.**
