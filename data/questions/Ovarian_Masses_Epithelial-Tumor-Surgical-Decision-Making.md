A 16-year-old girl is diagnosed with a Stage IA mucinous epithelial ovarian tumor. She desires future fertility. What is the most appropriate surgical management strategy?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Surgical decision making** for epithelial ovarian tumors in pediatric and adolescent patients differs substantially from that in older adults. In contrast to traditional radical surgery in adults, the **goal in young patients** is to balance **oncologic safety with fertility preservation**.

**Key surgical principles:**  
- **Stage IA tumors** (limited to one ovary, capsule intact, negative cytology) may be treated with **unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy** while preserving the **contralateral ovary and uterus**. The **contralateral ovary** should be **carefully examined** and **biopsied only if abnormal**.  
- **Stage IB disease** (both ovaries involved) can be treated with **bilateral gonadectomy** while **preserving the uterus** for potential **future in vitro fertilization**.  
- **Advanced-stage disease** requires **maximal cytoreduction**, including **total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy**, and removal of visible disease. This approach improves survival in advanced stages.  
- **Borderline epithelial tumors** may be treated with **ovarian-sparing surgery** and **close surveillance**. Although recurrence rates vary (36% after cystectomy, 15% after oophorectomy, 6% after hysterectomy/BSO), **overall survival exceeds 95–100%**, as recurrences are generally salvageable.

| **Stage** | **Surgical Approach** | **Fertility Preservation** |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **IA** | Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy | Yes |
| **IB** | Bilateral oophorectomy, preserve uterus | Possible (IVF) |
| **≥II** | Cytoreductive surgery (TAH-BSO, omentectomy) | No |
| **Borderline** | Ovarian-sparing resection, close follow-up | Yes |

**Clinical takeaway:** Conservative, fertility-preserving surgery is appropriate for early-stage and borderline epithelial tumors if the patient can adhere to surveillance. Aggressive cytoreduction remains essential for advanced disease.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A/B/C:** Radical surgery is unnecessary for early-stage or borderline tumors.  
- **E:** Uterine preservation is appropriate in selected bilateral cases.

**Correct answer: D — Stage IA epithelial tumors may be managed with unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and fertility preservation if surveillance is feasible.**
