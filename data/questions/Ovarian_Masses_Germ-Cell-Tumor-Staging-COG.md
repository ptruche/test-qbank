A 13-year-old girl undergoes oophorectomy for an ovarian yolk sac tumor. The tumor capsule is intact, peritoneal washings are negative, and postoperative αFP levels normalize after an appropriate half-life decline. According to the **Children’s Oncology Group (COG)** system, what stage is assigned?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Ovarian germ cell tumors** are staged using the **Children’s Oncology Group (COG)** system, which differs from the **FIGO** classification applied to epithelial and sex cord-stromal tumors. The COG staging system integrates **operative findings**, **cytology**, **tumor markers**, and **metastatic status**.

| **Stage** | **Criteria** |
|------------|---------------|
| **I** | Tumor limited to one or both ovaries; negative cytology; no extra-ovarian disease; **tumor markers normalize** postoperatively. The presence of **gliomatosis peritonei** does **not** upstage the tumor. |
| **II** | Capsule rupture or preoperative biopsy but **no residual tumor** and **negative cytology**; nodes negative. |
| **III** | Lymph node involvement, residual tumor, contiguous visceral invasion, or positive peritoneal cytology. |
| **IV** | Distant metastases (e.g., liver, lung). |

This patient meets all criteria for **Stage I** disease. Her normalized αFP confirms complete resection without residual disease. The key distinction from FIGO is that **tumor marker normalization** is explicitly included in stage determination.

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** FIGO staging applies to epithelial, not germ cell tumors.  
- **B:** Stage II requires capsule rupture or biopsy violation, not positive cytology.  
- **D:** Gliomatosis peritonei is **benign** and does **not alter stage**.  
- **E:** Stage IV requires **distant metastasis**, not microscopic peritoneal disease.

**Correct answer: C — Germ cell tumors are staged using the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) system, with Stage I confined to the ovaries and negative cytology.**
