correct: C
A: Tumor marker monitoring can be stopped once postoperative normalization occurs
B: αFP should be checked annually for the first five years after resection
C: Tumor markers such as αFP and βhCG should be monitored frequently (weekly to monthly) during the first 6–12 months postoperatively
D: Imaging is more sensitive than tumor markers for detecting early relapse
E: Follow-up intensity is identical for all histologic subtypes of germ cell tumor

A 13-year-old girl undergoes resection of a Stage I yolk sac tumor and is placed on surveillance without adjuvant chemotherapy. According to consensus guidelines, what is the most appropriate **tumor marker follow-up schedule**?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Ovarian germ cell tumors (GCTs)** require **frequent and structured postoperative follow-up**, especially during the first year after resection, when nearly all relapses occur.  
In cases of **Stage I disease under observation**, early recurrence is the main risk. Therefore, **tumor marker surveillance**—particularly **αFP and βhCG**—must be performed **weekly to every three weeks** for the first **six months**, and **monthly thereafter** for the first year.

| **Guideline Source** | **αFP Monitoring Frequency (Stage I)** |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **German GPOH** | Weekly |
| **Children’s Oncology Group (COG)** | Every 3 weeks |
| **National Cancer Institute (NCI)** | Monthly for 6 months |

Since **87.5% of recurrences** occur within the first **nine months**, early detection through **serial marker measurement** is essential. Marker rise precedes radiologic evidence of relapse, allowing early intervention.

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/B:** Marker monitoring continues beyond normalization, not annually.  
- **D:** Imaging complements but does not surpass tumor markers for early relapse detection.  
- **E:** Follow-up schedules differ by stage and histology.

**Correct answer: C — Tumor markers such as αFP and βhCG should be monitored frequently (weekly to monthly) during the first 6–12 months postoperatively.**
