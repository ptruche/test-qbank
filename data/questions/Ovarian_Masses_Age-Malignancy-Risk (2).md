A 7-year-old girl presents with a palpable lower abdominal mass and intermittent pain. Ultrasound reveals a 6-cm complex ovarian lesion with both solid and cystic components. Tumor markers are pending. Her parents ask about the likelihood of this being malignant compared with an adolescent presenting with a similar mass.  

Which of the following statements best reflects the relationship between age and malignancy risk in pediatric ovarian neoplasms?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The risk of malignancy among pediatric ovarian tumors does not increase linearly with age. In fact, while ovarian masses become more common during adolescence due to hormonal maturation and the formation of functional cysts, the **proportion** of malignant neoplasms is *higher in prepubescent girls*. Large population-based studies, including data from the SEER registry, demonstrate that the incidence of malignant ovarian tumors is approximately **0.1 per 100,000 in girls under 9 years** compared to **1.0 per 100,000 in adolescents aged 10–19 years**. However, when expressed as a proportion of all ovarian neoplasms, malignancy rates are roughly **20–25% in prepubertal girls** versus **10–15% in adolescents**.

This pattern occurs because functional and benign cystic lesions dominate the adolescent population, diluting the relative percentage of malignant cases. Conversely, in younger girls, most ovarian lesions are neoplastic rather than physiologic, thereby enriching the pool for malignancy. Germ cell tumors—particularly **yolk sac tumors and dysgerminomas**—predominate across all pediatric age groups and account for roughly **75% of neoplastic ovarian lesions** in those under 20 years. Epithelial tumors, which are common in adults, are exceedingly rare before puberty.

| Age group | Incidence of ovarian neoplasm (per 100,000) | % Malignant among neoplasms | Predominant histology |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| <1 year    | Very low                                   | <1%                         | Germ cell (rare)      |
| 1–8 years  | 0.1–0.2                                    | 20–25%                      | Germ cell             |
| 9–19 years | 1.0                                        | 10–15%                      | Germ cell             |
| Adults     | 11.0                                       | High (mostly epithelial)    | Epithelial            |

This epidemiologic relationship underscores a key clinical principle: **a solid ovarian mass in a prepubescent girl warrants heightened suspicion for malignancy**, whereas an ovarian cyst in an adolescent is far more likely benign or physiologic. Nevertheless, most pediatric ovarian malignancies are curable with fertility-sparing surgery and adjuvant therapy when indicated, unlike adult epithelial ovarian cancers, which often present with advanced disease and poor outcomes.

**Correct answer: C — Prepubescent girls have a higher proportion of malignancy despite lower incidence.**
