A 7-year-old girl presents with increasing abdominal distension and intermittent lower abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrates a complex ovarian mass measuring 6 cm. Laboratory testing shows mildly elevated AFP but normal β-hCG. The family asks about the likelihood that this mass is malignant compared with an adolescent presenting with the same finding. 

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

While ovarian tumors become more common during adolescence, the *proportion* that are malignant does not increase with age. In fact, prepubescent girls (ages 1–8 years) have a **higher rate of malignant histology (approximately 22%)** than adolescents (about 10%), even though overall tumor incidence is lower in younger children. The risk of malignancy in infants is extremely low, with only isolated cases of cancer under 12 months of age. These data come from large registry and cohort studies (e.g., SEER, Lindfors et al.) showing that while total ovarian tumor incidence rises sharply after puberty, the malignant fraction decreases with age.

The predominant pathologic subtype in pediatric ovarian neoplasms is **germ cell tumors (≈75%)**, which dominate in all age groups under 20 years. Epithelial ovarian tumors, which account for the majority of adult ovarian malignancies, are exceedingly uncommon before adolescence and carry a much poorer prognosis in older patients due to advanced presentation and limited treatment options. 

| **Age Group** | **Relative Incidence** | **Malignancy Rate** | **Common Histology** |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| <1 year | Very low | ~1% | Teratoma (benign) |
| 1–8 years (prepubertal) | Low | **~22%** | Germ cell (dysgerminoma, yolk sac) |
| 9–19 years (adolescent) | High | **~10%** | Germ cell (mature teratoma, dysgerminoma) |
| Adult | Very high | **~90% epithelial** | Epithelial (serous, mucinous) |

Syndromic associations should also be considered when evaluating ovarian masses in children. **DICER1** syndrome predisposes to Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors; **Peutz-Jeghers** to granulosa or sex cord–stromal tumors; and **McCune-Albright** to recurrent cystic lesions due to hormonal hyperactivity. Recognition of these associations helps avoid unnecessary surgery in benign, hormonally mediated cases and ensures appropriate tumor surveillance in at-risk populations.

**Correct answer: B — Prepubescent girls have a higher proportion of malignant ovarian tumors than adolescents.**
