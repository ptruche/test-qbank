A 13-year-old girl presents with abdominal fullness and a right adnexal mass on ultrasound.  
You recall that ovarian masses in children differ significantly in frequency and malignancy pattern compared with adults.  
Which of the following statements best reflects the epidemiology of ovarian neoplasms in children and adolescents?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

### 🧠 **Teaching Summary**

Ovarian masses are uncommon in children — roughly **5 per 100,000 per year** — and **about half** are neoplastic. Of these, only **10–20%** are malignant.  
While ovarian cancer represents **~1% of all childhood malignancies**, **ovarian neoplasms are the most common gynecologic tumors under 20 years**, with a **dramatic shift in histologic type** compared with adults.

| Age group | Incidence (per 100k/yr) | Predominant histology | Notes |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| \<9 years  | 0.1                     | Germ cell (esp. yolk sac) | Malignancy rare \<5 yrs |
| 10–19 yrs  | 1.0                     | Germ cell              | Majority benign |
| Adults     | 11                      | Epithelial             | Often advanced & metastatic |

### 🩺 **Key Points**

- **Germ cell tumors** constitute **~75% of pediatric ovarian neoplasms**, whereas only **20% of adult tumors** are germ cell in origin.  
- **Epithelial tumors** dominate in adults (and confer worse prognosis).  
- **Prepubescent girls (1–8 yrs)** have a *higher malignancy rate (≈22%)* compared with adolescents (≈10%), despite a *lower overall incidence*.  
- **Infant malignancy** is exceedingly rare — only isolated case reports.  
- **Syndromic associations** to remember:
  - **DICER1** → Sertoli–Leydig tumors  
  - **Peutz–Jeghers** → Granulosa / sex cord–stromal tumors  
  - **Ollier / Maffucci** → Juvenile granulosa  
  - **McCune–Albright** → Recurrent cysts, autonomous estrogen production  
  - **Basal cell nevus syndrome** → Ovarian fibromas
