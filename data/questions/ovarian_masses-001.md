A 10-year-old girl presents with an enlarging right adnexal mass. She has mild abdominal discomfort but is otherwise well. Ultrasound shows a 6 cm solid and cystic lesion with internal echoes and calcifications. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).  
Which of the following best describes the typical histologic pattern of malignant ovarian tumors in this age group?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Ovarian tumors in children and adolescents are uncommon, occurring in roughly five per 100,000 per year, and only about half of these are true neoplasms. The majority are benign, but approximately 10–20% harbor malignant histology. The pattern of disease in young patients is distinctly different from adults. In patients under 20 years of age, the large majority of ovarian tumors are of germ cell origin—accounting for nearly three-quarters of all neoplasms—whereas in adults, epithelial tumors predominate and are frequently advanced at diagnosis.

The incidence of ovarian tumors rises with age through adolescence, but the risk of malignancy does not follow this increase. Malignancy is exceedingly rare in infants, appears in about 20–25% of tumors in prepubertal girls (ages 1–8), and falls to approximately 10% in adolescents. Thus, although ovarian tumors become more common in older girls, the proportion that are malignant decreases after puberty.  

Among malignant ovarian tumors in children, germ cell tumors—particularly yolk sac tumors and dysgerminomas—are the predominant types. These often secrete serum markers such as AFP or β-hCG, aiding diagnosis and follow-up. Epithelial ovarian carcinomas, which dominate the adult landscape, are exceedingly rare in the pediatric population.

Certain inherited and developmental syndromes are associated with characteristic ovarian tumors. DICER1 syndrome predisposes to Sertoli–Leydig cell tumors. Peutz–Jeghers syndrome can lead to granulosa or sex cord–stromal tumors with annular tubules. McCune–Albright syndrome may present with recurrent estrogen-producing follicular cysts, while Maffucci and Ollier syndromes are associated with juvenile granulosa and Sertoli–Leydig tumors. Basal cell nevus syndrome can lead to ovarian fibromas, and Chédiak–Higashi syndrome may be linked to sclerosing stromal tumors.  

The following illustration summarizes the major distinctions between pediatric and adult ovarian tumors.

In summary, ovarian tumors in children and adolescents are rare and usually of germ cell origin. Recognition of this distinct distribution is essential to avoid overtreatment and to guide use of tumor markers, fertility-sparing surgery, and appropriate oncologic follow-up.

**Correct answer: C — Germ cell tumors are the predominant malignant ovarian neoplasm in children and adolescents.**
