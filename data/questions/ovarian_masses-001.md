A 13-year-old girl presents with abdominal fullness and a right adnexal mass on ultrasound. You recall that ovarian masses in children differ significantly in frequency and malignancy pattern compared with adults. Which of the following statements best reflects the epidemiology of ovarian neoplasms in children and adolescents?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

### Teaching Summary

Ovarian masses are uncommon in children (about 5 per 100,000 per year), and roughly half are neoplastic. Only 10–20% of neoplastic lesions are malignant. While ovarian cancer represents ~1% of all childhood malignancies, ovarian neoplasms are the most common gynecologic tumors under age 20, with a marked shift in histology compared with adults.

| Age group | Incidence (per 100k/yr) | Predominant histology | Notes |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| <9 years  | 0.1                      | Germ cell             | Malignancy rare <5 yrs |
| 10–19 yrs | 1.0                      | Germ cell             | Majority benign overall |
| Adults    | 11                       | Epithelial            | Often advanced at dx |

### Key Points

- Germ cell tumors comprise ~75% of pediatric ovarian neoplasms, versus ~20% in adults.
- Epithelial tumors dominate in adults and carry worse prognosis; uncommon in adolescents and rare prepubertally.
- Prepubescent girls (1–8 years) have a higher malignancy rate (~22%) than adolescents (~10%) despite lower overall incidence.
- Infant ovarian malignancy is exceedingly rare.
- Syndromic associations to remember:
  - DICER1 → Sertoli–Leydig tumors
  - Peutz–Jeghers → Granulosa; sex cord–stromal with annular tubules; cystadenomas
  - Ollier/Maffucci → Juvenile granulosa; Sertoli–Leydig
  - McCune–Albright → Recurrent cysts, autonomous estrogen production (not all require resection)
  - Basal cell nevus syndrome → Ovarian fibromas

### Dry-Erase Concept Sketch

```
CHILD/ADOLESCENT (<20y)                  ADULT
┌─────────────────────────┐              ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Germ Cell  ≈ 75%        │              │ Epithelial ≈ 80%    │
│ Epithelial ≈ 20%        │              │ Germ Cell ≈ 20%     │
└─────────────────────────┘              └─────────────────────┘
      ↑ malignancy 10–20% (overall)
      Higher rate in prepubertal; lower in teens
```

### Exam Integration

- Younger age → think germ cell first, even when malignant.
- Do not assume epithelial carcinoma in adolescents; rare before puberty.
- Clinical pearl: An adnexal mass in a teen is germ cell until proven otherwise.

**Correct Answer: D — Germ cell tumors account for the majority of ovarian neoplasms in girls under 20.**
