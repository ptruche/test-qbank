id: OM-049
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: D
A: Steroid cell tumors typically occur bilaterally and are estrogen-secreting in most children
B: They are malignant in nearly all pediatric cases and require chemotherapy
C: Reinke’s crystals are characteristic of stromal luteomas
D: Steroid cell tumors include stromal luteoma, Leydig cell tumor, and steroid cell tumor not otherwise specified; they are usually benign and androgen-secreting
E: These tumors arise from germ cells and are classified as germ cell neoplasms

A 9-year-old girl presents with progressive hirsutism, deepening of the voice, and clitoral enlargement. Laboratory studies reveal elevated testosterone and androstenedione with low gonadotropin levels. Imaging shows a unilateral ovarian mass. Which of the following statements best describes this tumor?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Steroid cell tumors (SCTs)**—previously called **lipid cell tumors**—are **rare sex cord–stromal tumors** known for their **steroid hormone secretion**. The updated term reflects their **morphology and endocrine activity**, as many contain **little or no lipid** despite their prior name.  

**Classification (by cell of origin):**
| **Subtype** | **Origin** | **Key Features** |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Stromal luteoma** | Stromal lutein cells | Small, contained in ovary; postmenopausal women |
| **Leydig cell tumor** | Ovarian hilum; contains **Reinke’s crystals** | Usually postmenopausal; androgenic |
| **Steroid cell tumor, NOS** | Undefined steroid-secreting cells | ~60% of SCTs; **younger patients**; androgenic |

**Clinical presentation:**
- **Androgenic features**: virilization, hirsutism, deepened voice, amenorrhea, and clitoromegaly.  
- **Laboratory findings**: elevated **testosterone** and **androstenedione**, increased **urinary 17-ketosteroids**, and **suppressed gonadotropins**.  
- Rarely, estrogenic activity can cause **isosexual precocity**.  
- In **children**, nearly all cases are **benign and low-stage**.  

**Management:**  
- **Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy** is curative in pediatric cases.  
- **Chemotherapy is not required** for benign lesions.  
- Hormonal symptoms usually **resolve** after resection. Some younger children may later develop **true precocious puberty** due to hypothalamic maturation following chronic androgen exposure.  

| **Feature** | **Steroid Cell Tumor (NOS)** |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| **Incidence** | Very rare (<1% of ovarian tumors) |
| **Hormonal activity** | Predominantly androgenic |
| **Laterality** | Unilateral |
| **Age group** | Young patients / children |
| **Prognosis** | Excellent (benign, low stage) |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/B/E:** These tumors are benign, unilateral, and of **stromal** (not germ cell) origin.  
- **C:** **Reinke’s crystals** are specific to **Leydig cell tumors**, not stromal luteomas.  

**Correct answer: D — Steroid cell tumors include stromal luteoma, Leydig cell tumor, and steroid cell tumor not otherwise specified; they are usually benign and androgen-secreting.**
