A 12-year-old girl presents with a suspected ovarian mass. Which of the following statements best describes the appropriate **imaging workup** in the evaluation of pediatric ovarian lesions?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Ultrasound (US)** is the **first-line imaging modality** for evaluating pediatric ovarian masses in all age groups. It is **noninvasive, radiation-free**, and provides **real-time assessment** of cystic versus solid features. **Adequate bladder distention** is required during pelvic ultrasound to **displace bowel gas** and **enhance sound wave transmission** to the ovaries.

When ultrasound findings are **inconclusive** or when **further delineation** of lesion origin or extent is required, **MRI** or **CT** are appropriate next steps:  
- **MRI** is preferred for **soft tissue characterization**, **pelvic organ delineation**, and **evaluation of local extension**, offering **superior contrast resolution** without radiation exposure.  
- **CT** is reserved for cases where **the mass origin is unclear** or **staging is needed**, such as suspected metastatic disease or **evaluation of ascites**.  
- **Chest CT** is indicated when **malignancy is confirmed** to assess for pulmonary metastases.  

| **Imaging Modality** | **Primary Use** | **Advantages** |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Ultrasound** | First-line screening | Safe, dynamic, cost-effective |
| **MRI** | Characterize complex lesions, assess invasion | High soft-tissue contrast, no radiation |
| **CT** | Evaluate metastasis or uncertain origin | Fast, defines anatomy, but involves radiation |
| **PET-CT** | Detect recurrence or metastasis | Used mainly for recurrent disease evaluation |

**PET-CT** has a limited role in initial diagnosis but may be used for **recurrent ovarian cancer**, especially when **CT/MRI are negative** but **tumor markers are rising**.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** CT is not first-line due to radiation exposure.  
- **B:** MRI offers excellent tissue contrast.  
- **D:** PET-CT is for recurrence, not routine use.  
- **E:** A **full bladder**, not an empty one, is required for optimal ultrasound imaging.

**Correct answer: C â€” Ultrasound is the first-line imaging study, with MRI or CT used for indeterminate or complex lesions.**
