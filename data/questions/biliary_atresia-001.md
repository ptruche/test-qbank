A 6-week-old infant presents with persistent jaundice, acholic stools, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory results show conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Abdominal ultrasound reveals an absent gallbladder. What is the next best step in management?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Teaching Point:**  
Biliary atresia is the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis requiring surgery. The key to management is *timing*: outcomes of Kasai portoenterostomy (hepatoportoenterostomy) are best when performed early—ideally before 45–60 days of life. Delays markedly increase the risk of liver fibrosis and the need for eventual transplantation.

**Rationale:**  
Ultrasound suggesting an absent or atretic gallbladder and elevated GGT are highly suggestive, but definitive diagnosis relies on intraoperative cholangiography. A phenobarbital-primed HIDA scan adds delay and has limited specificity. When suspicion is high, proceeding to operative cholangiography (and, if confirmed, immediate Kasai) is recommended.

**Key takeaway:**  
Do *not* delay definitive intervention with unnecessary imaging; early surgical evaluation offers the best chance of long-term bile drainage and native liver survival.
