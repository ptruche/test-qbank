id: OM-005B
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: D
A: Precocious puberty is most often due to germ cell tumors producing β-hCG
B: Virilization occurs exclusively in dysgerminomas containing syncytial trophoblastic giant cells
C: Endocrine manifestations are seen in less than 1% of pediatric ovarian tumors
D: Sex cord–stromal tumors can cause precocious puberty due to estrogen secretion
E: Endocrine activity is never associated with malignancy in ovarian tumors

A 6-year-old girl presents with breast development and vaginal bleeding. Ultrasound shows a solid ovarian mass. Serum estradiol is markedly elevated. Which of the following tumor types most likely explains this presentation?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Ovarian tumors can be **hormonally active**, producing either **estrogen** (causing precocious puberty) or **androgens** (causing virilization). **Sex cord–stromal tumors**, particularly **juvenile granulosa cell tumors** and some **Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors**, produce **estrogen**, leading to precocious puberty. Conversely, **Sertoli-Leydig** and certain **dysgerminomas** with syncytial trophoblastic elements may secrete androgens, causing virilization. Roughly **2–16%** of ovarian neoplasms present with endocrine manifestations, and in these patients, **50–60% are malignant**.

| **Hormonal Presentation** | **Likely Tumor Type** | **Hormone Secreted** |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Precocious puberty | Juvenile granulosa, Sertoli-Leydig | Estrogen |
| Virilization | Sertoli-Leydig, dysgerminoma (trophoblastic), yolk sac | Androgen / hCG |
| Precocious pseudopuberty | Germ cell tumors (yolk sac, dysgerminoma, choriocarcinoma) | hCG |

**Correct answer: D — Sex cord–stromal tumors can cause precocious puberty due to estrogen secretion.**
