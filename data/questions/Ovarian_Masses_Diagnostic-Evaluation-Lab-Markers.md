id: OM-010
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: D
A: CA-125 and CEA are the most specific tumor markers for malignancy in pediatric ovarian masses
B: LDH is rarely elevated in malignant pediatric ovarian tumors
C: AFP and β-hCG testing alone is sufficient for all preoperative evaluations
D: A complete tumor marker panel should include AFP, β-hCG, LDH, CA-125, CA 19-9, CEA, estradiol, testosterone, and Inhibin A/B
E: Tumor markers have poor diagnostic accuracy and are not recommended preoperatively

A 13-year-old girl is found to have a 9 cm adnexal mass on ultrasound. She has no signs of torsion or acute abdomen. Which of the following best describes the recommended **preoperative laboratory evaluation** for risk stratification in pediatric ovarian masses?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

A **comprehensive tumor marker panel** is essential in the **preoperative evaluation of pediatric ovarian masses**. When a patient presents **without torsion**, time should be taken for **laboratory and imaging assessment** to distinguish **benign from malignant lesions**. This process helps determine whether **ovarian-sparing surgery** or **oncologic resection with staging** is appropriate.

**The recommended laboratory evaluation includes:**  
- **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**  
- **Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)**  
- **Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)**  
- **Cancer antigens:** CA-125, CA 19-9  
- **Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)**  
- **Hormonal markers:** estradiol, testosterone, **Inhibin A** and **Inhibin B**  

**LDH** is the **most sensitive** of the tumor markers, with **98% of malignant ovarian tumors** showing elevation in one large multi-institutional study, yet it was obtained in only **39%** of cases. **AFP** and **β-hCG** are the **most commonly tested**, as they are strongly associated with **germ cell tumors**, the predominant malignant histology in this population.

| **Marker** | **Commonly Elevated In** | **Key Notes** |
|-------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **AFP** | Yolk sac tumor, mixed germ cell tumor | Specific for malignant germ cell origin |
| **β-hCG** | Choriocarcinoma, dysgerminoma with syncytial trophoblastic cells | May cause precocious pseudopuberty |
| **LDH** | Dysgerminoma | Most sensitive overall marker |
| **CA-125 / CEA** | Epithelial tumors, inflammation, menstruation | Non-specific, may rise in benign states |
| **Inhibin A/B, estradiol, testosterone** | Sex cord–stromal tumors | Indicate endocrine activity |

Although **mild elevations** of markers like **CA-125 or CEA** can occur with **non-malignant conditions** (PID, endometriosis, menstruation), **significant or multiple elevations** warrant concern for malignancy. Therefore, **marker interpretation should always be contextual**, incorporating imaging, physical findings, and clinical history.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** CA-125 and CEA lack specificity and can rise with benign inflammation.  
- **B:** LDH is elevated in nearly all malignant cases.  
- **C:** AFP and β-hCG alone are insufficient.  
- **E:** Tumor markers are critical for risk stratification and surgical planning.

**Correct answer: D — A complete tumor marker panel should include AFP, β-hCG, LDH, CA-125, CA 19-9, CEA, estradiol, testosterone, and Inhibin A/B.**
