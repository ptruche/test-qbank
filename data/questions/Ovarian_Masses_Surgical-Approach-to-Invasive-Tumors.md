A 13-year-old girl presents with a large ovarian mass adherent to bowel and encasing pelvic vessels. Tumor markers are markedly elevated. What is the most appropriate initial management?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

In pediatric ovarian malignancy, **large or invasive lesions** that appear to **encase major vessels or adjacent organs** should **not be resected at the index operation**. Attempting resection under these conditions risks **vascular injury**, **tumor rupture**, and **upstaging**. Instead, a **diagnostic biopsy** should be obtained, followed by **neoadjuvant chemotherapy**, and then **definitive resection** once the tumor is operable.  

**Tumor rupture during resection** can disseminate malignant cells, **upstaging** the disease and **increasing chemotherapy requirements**. Similarly, **laparoscopic manipulation** of large malignant tumors is discouraged, as inadvertent spillage compromises outcomes.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Immediate resection risks rupture and morbidity.  
- **C:** Rupture **does** alter stage and prognosis.  
- **D:** Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is standard for unresectable disease.  
- **E:** Minimally invasive debulking of invasive tumors is contraindicated.

**Correct answer: B â€” Large invasive tumors encasing vessels should be biopsied first, with resection planned after chemotherapy.**
