A 12-year-old girl presents with increasing abdominal girth and a palpable lower abdominal mass. Ultrasound reveals a unilateral solid-cystic ovarian mass without ascites. Serum tumor markers show an elevated AFP and normal β-hCG. The patient undergoes oophorectomy, and pathology confirms a yolk sac tumor. Which of the following statements best describes the pathophysiology and epidemiology of this tumor type?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Ovarian neoplasms in children and adolescents arise from one of three embryologic cell lineages: (1) **germinal epithelium** covering the urogenital ridge, (2) **underlying stromal (mesenchymal) elements** of the urogenital ridge, and (3) **germ cells** that migrate from the yolk sac to the developing gonad. Each of these lineages can undergo neoplastic transformation through processes of dedifferentiation, proliferation, and—eventually—malignant transformation. The relative frequency of these tumors varies markedly by age, reflecting developmental and hormonal influences on ovarian tissue.

**Germ cell tumors**, derived from primordial germ cells originating in the yolk sac, are the dominant category of ovarian neoplasms in children and adolescents, representing roughly **60–77%** of cases. They encompass a spectrum ranging from benign **mature teratomas** to malignant lesions such as **dysgerminoma**, **yolk sac tumor (endodermal sinus tumor)**, and **immature teratoma**. These tumors reflect the totipotential nature of germ cells, which retain the capacity for multiple differentiation pathways, leading to diverse histologic appearances. The pathogenesis often involves aberrant proliferation of germ cells that have failed to undergo normal maturation or apoptotic regression during gonadal development.

In contrast, **epithelial tumors**—derived from the germinal epithelium—account for only **~15%** of pediatric ovarian tumors but become the dominant group in adults, where adenocarcinomas (serous, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell) predominate. **Sex cord–stromal tumors**, such as granulosa cell and Sertoli–Leydig cell tumors, arise from the gonadal stroma and cords of the urogenital ridge. These lesions may secrete hormones and are most frequent in the **first four years of life**, occasionally leading to isosexual precocity due to estrogen or androgen excess.

Malignant transformation in ovarian neoplasms is thought to evolve from benign or borderline precursors under hormonal stimulation or genetic alterations affecting differentiation pathways. Intermediate lesions—termed **tumors of low malignant potential**—illustrate this continuum between benign and malignant epithelial tumors.

| **Tumor Origin** | **Embryologic Source** | **Age Group Predominance** | **Examples** | **Typical Behavior** |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Germ Cell        | Yolk sac (primordial germ cells) | Children & adolescents | Dysgerminoma, Yolk sac tumor, Teratoma | 60–77% of pediatric ovarian neoplasms |
| Epithelial       | Germinal epithelium of urogenital ridge | Adults, older teens | Serous, mucinous, endometrioid tumors | ~15% in pediatrics |
| Sex Cord–Stromal | Stroma and cords of urogenital ridge | Early childhood | Granulosa cell, Sertoli–Leydig | May secrete hormones |

Rare ovarian tumors in children include endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas, Brenner tumors, lymphomas, and metastatic lesions. These are typically malignant and should prompt evaluation for systemic disease or metastatic sources.

**Correct answer: C — Germ cell tumors originate from primordial germ cells derived from the yolk sac and are the most common ovarian neoplasms in children and adolescents.**
