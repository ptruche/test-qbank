A 13-year-old girl undergoes oophorectomy for a yolk sac tumor. The tumor is confined to the ovary, and peritoneal cytology is negative. Postoperative imaging shows no residual or metastatic disease. The resident asks how this tumor would be staged compared with adult ovarian cancer.

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Staging of **pediatric ovarian germ cell tumors** differs fundamentally from that of adult ovarian malignancies. Adult epithelial and sex cord–stromal tumors are typically staged using the **FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics)** system, which relies on operative and pathologic findings to determine the extent of disease. In contrast, pediatric **germ cell tumors** are staged according to the **Children’s Oncology Group (COG)** system, which was specifically designed to reflect the biology and treatment principles of germ cell neoplasms in children and adolescents.

The **COG staging system** focuses on surgical findings, completeness of resection, peritoneal cytology, and the presence of nodal or distant metastases. It explicitly notes that **gliomatosis peritonei**, a benign implantation of glial tissue seen in association with immature teratomas, **does not upstage** disease to a higher level.

| **COG Stage** | **Extent of Disease** | **Key Notes** |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **I** | Limited to ovary; peritoneal evaluation negative; no evidence of spread | Presence of *gliomatosis peritonei* does **not** change stage |
| **II** | Microscopic residual disease; peritoneal evaluation negative | *Gliomatosis peritonei* again does not alter stage |
| **III** | Gross residual disease, lymph node involvement, or contiguous visceral invasion; peritoneal cytology positive | Includes spread to omentum, bowel, or bladder |
| **IV** | Distant metastases including liver, lung, or other extraperitoneal sites | Represents disseminated disease |

This COG staging system guides both adjuvant chemotherapy selection and long-term surveillance strategies. For instance, Stage I disease can often be managed with surgery alone and careful observation, while Stage II–IV typically require platinum-based multiagent chemotherapy (e.g., bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin). Understanding this distinction from FIGO staging ensures appropriate management tailored to pediatric tumor biology.

**Correct answer: C — Pediatric ovarian germ cell tumors are staged using the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) system.**
