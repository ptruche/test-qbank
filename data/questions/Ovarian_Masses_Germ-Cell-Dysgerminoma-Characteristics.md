correct: C
A: Dysgerminoma commonly elevates alpha-fetoprotein levels
B: Dysgerminoma typically presents in infancy and is usually bilateral

A 14-year-old girl presents with abdominal pain and a large solid ovarian mass. Serum tumor markers show elevated LDH but normal αFP and βhCG. What is the most likely diagnosis?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Dysgerminoma** is the **most common malignant ovarian germ cell tumor** in pediatric patients, accounting for roughly **one-third** of malignant ovarian GCTs. It most commonly occurs in **adolescents and young women**, but **~5% occur in prepubertal girls**.

**Key features:**
- **Marker:** LDH elevation (reflecting rapid cellular turnover); αFP and βhCG are typically **normal** unless mixed elements are present.  
- **Laterality:** Bilateral in **10–30%** of cases.  
- **Appearance:** Solid, thick, white, lobulated tumor; may rupture and present with pain.  
- **Special features:** Can cause **hypercalcemia** due to paraneoplastic secretion of PTH-related peptide.  

| **Characteristic** | **Dysgerminoma** |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Age | Adolescents (10–20 yrs) |
| Marker | LDH ↑, αFP and βhCG normal |
| Bilaterality | 10–30% |
| Paraneoplastic | Hypercalcemia |
| Prognosis | Excellent with resection ± chemotherapy |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A, E:** αFP and βhCG are typically normal.  
- **B:** Infancy presentation is rare.  
- **D:** Dysgerminoma is a distinct entity, not a teratomatous variant.

**Correct answer: C — Dysgerminoma is the most common malignant ovarian germ cell tumor, associated with LDH elevation and hypercalcemia.**
