A multi-institutional review of pediatric ovarian neoplasms found that one particular tumor marker was elevated in 98% of malignant cases but was ordered in fewer than 40% of patients. Which marker demonstrates this pattern?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)** is the most sensitive tumor marker in pediatric ovarian malignancy, elevated in approximately **98% of patients with malignant disease**. Despite its high sensitivity, LDH is often **underutilized**, with studies showing it is obtained in fewer than 40% of preoperative evaluations. LDH elevation reflects high metabolic activity in rapidly proliferating germ cell tumors, particularly **dysgerminomas**. 

While **AFP** and **β-hCG** are highly specific for certain germ cell subtypes (yolk sac and choriocarcinoma, respectively), their overall sensitivity across all malignant ovarian tumors is lower. Inhibin A and B are useful for sex cord–stromal tumors but are not universally elevated. Therefore, a full tumor marker panel—particularly including LDH—is critical for accurate preoperative assessment.

**Correct answer: C — LDH is the most sensitive tumor marker in malignant pediatric ovarian disease.**
