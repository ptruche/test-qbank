A 10-year-old girl presents with a pelvic mass. Laboratory evaluation reveals an elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Based on the typical cellular origin of pediatric ovarian tumors, which of the following statements best describes the likely pathophysiology of this patient’s lesion?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **pathophysiology of ovarian neoplasms** depends on the embryologic lineage from which the tumor arises. There are **three principal sources** of ovarian neoplastic transformation:  
1. **Germinal epithelium** covering the urogenital ridge (→ epithelial tumors)  
2. **Underlying stromal elements** of the urogenital ridge (→ sex cord–stromal tumors)  
3. **Germ cells originating from the yolk sac** (→ germ cell tumors)  

**Germ cell tumors** are the **most common ovarian neoplasms in children and adolescents**, representing approximately **60–77%** of pediatric ovarian tumors. These tumors arise from **germ cells derived from the yolk sac** and undergo **dedifferentiation and proliferation** with potential **malignant transformation**. Tumor subtypes include **dysgerminoma**, **endodermal sinus (yolk sac) tumor**, **immature teratoma**, and **mixed germ cell tumors**. They often produce tumor markers such as **AFP** (yolk sac tumor) or **β-hCG** (choriocarcinoma elements).  

In contrast, **epithelial tumors**, which originate from the **germinal epithelium covering the ovary**, are the **predominant neoplasms in adults**. These include **serous, mucinous, and endometrioid adenocarcinomas**, which often display **low malignant potential (LMP)** or **borderline forms** in early transformation stages. **Malignant transformation** in these lesions likely occurs as a result of **hormonal stimulation** and progressive **genetic dysregulation**. These tumors are **rare in children**, accounting for roughly **15%** of pediatric ovarian neoplasms.  

**Sex cord–stromal tumors**, derived from **mesenchymal (stromal) elements** of the urogenital ridge, include **granulosa cell tumors**, **thecomas**, and **Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors**. They can **secrete hormones**, leading to **precocious puberty** or **virilization** in prepubertal girls. These tumors show a **bimodal age distribution**, with a **peak in the first 4 years of life** and another in later adulthood.

| **Tumor Category** | **Cell of Origin** | **Age Group Predominance** | **Representative Tumors** | **Key Features** |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Germ cell tumors | Germ cells from yolk sac | Children, adolescents | Dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, immature teratoma | 60–77% of pediatric cases; elevated AFP/β-hCG |
| Epithelial tumors | Germinal epithelium covering ovary | Adults, older teens | Serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell | Most adult ovarian cancers; 15% pediatric |
| Sex cord–stromal tumors | Stromal elements of urogenital ridge | Young children, adults | Juvenile granulosa, Sertoli-Leydig, thecoma | Hormone-producing; precocity or virilization |

**Age-related patterns** are a critical clue in diagnosis. **Germ cell tumors dominate in childhood**, **sex cord–stromal tumors** appear most often in **infancy and early childhood**, and **epithelial tumors** rise in **late adolescence and adulthood**. Rare entities in children include **endometrioid**, **clear cell**, and **Brenner tumors**, as well as **lymphoma** and **metastatic lesions** to the ovary.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Epithelial tumors are rare in children, comprising only ~15% of cases.  
- **B:** Sex cord–stromal tumors predominate in early childhood, not adolescence.  
- **D:** Epithelial tumors derive from **germinal epithelium**, not stromal elements.  
- **E:** Endometrioid and clear cell tumors are rare in pediatrics and typically malignant when present.

**Correct answer: C — Germ cell tumors arise from yolk sac–derived germ cells and are the most common pediatric ovarian neoplasms.**
