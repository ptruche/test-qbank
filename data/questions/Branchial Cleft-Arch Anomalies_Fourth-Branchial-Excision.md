id: BCA-015
subject: Branchial Cleft/Arch Anomalies
correct: C
A: Fourth branchial cleft anomalies are typically right-sided and superficial to the carotid sheath, rarely requiring thyroid resection.
B: Excision of fourth branchial cleft anomalies should be attempted through a transoral approach to the pyriform sinus.
C: Excision requires a cosmetic neck incision, deep dissection looping around great vessels, identification of the pyriform sinus opening via endoscopy, and may necessitate hemithyroidectomy.
D: Drain placement and intraoperative fluoroscopy are contraindicated due to contamination risk.
E: Parathyroid glands are never at risk during fourth branchial anomaly excision.

A 9-year-old girl presents with recurrent left-sided neck abscesses and suppurative thyroiditis. Imaging suggests a tract extending from the pyriform sinus toward the thyroid lobe and inferiorly into the mediastinum. Which of the following best describes the correct surgical approach to manage this lesion?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Fourth branchial cleft anomalies** are the **rarest of the branchial remnants** and are most often found on the **left side**. They may present with **recurrent neck infections**, **abscesses**, or **suppurative thyroiditis**, frequently due to infection within the **descending tract loop**. Because of their complex and variable anatomy, surgery requires meticulous planning and precise dissection.

### **Surgical Approach**
- **Incision and exposure:**  
  A **cosmetic skin incision** is made along a cervical skin crease at the **base of the sternocleidomastoid muscle**, allowing access to the cyst or sinus tract.  

- **Endoscopic guidance:**  
  Identification of the **internal opening in the pyriform sinus** is aided by **endoscopy**, which may allow **insertion of a Fogarty catheter** or **feeding tube** to guide dissection.  
  **Contrast injection** under **intraoperative fluoroscopy** can help define the full course of the tract.

- **Course of dissection:**  
  The tract typically takes a **serpiginous path**:  
  - Passes **behind the common carotid artery**  
  - Turns near the **hypoglossal nerve**  
  - Descends to **loop around**:  
    - The **aortic arch** on the **left**, or  
    - The **subclavian artery** on the **right**  
  - Then ascends **beneath the superior laryngeal nerve**, passing toward the **thyroid membrane** and ending in the **pyriform sinus**.  
  The **descending loop** of the tract is the usual site of **infection**.

- **Extent of excision:**  
  **Ipsilateral hemithyroidectomy** may be necessary for complete removal, particularly when the tract passes through or abuts the thyroid gland. **Excision of thyroid cartilage** may also be needed for proximal tract exposure.  
  Because parathyroid tissue can occasionally be removed with the specimen, **postoperative calcium monitoring** is advised.

- **Adjuncts and closure:**  
  - **Step-ladder incisions** may be employed for better exposure.  
  - **Drain placement** is appropriate to prevent fluid accumulation.  
  - If **infection is present**, antibiotics and staged excision are indicated.  

| **Step** | **Key Consideration** |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Skin incision | Cosmetic, at base of SCM |
| Tract identification | Endoscopy ± Fogarty catheter, fluoroscopy |
| Course | Loops around aortic/subclavian artery, ascends beneath SLN |
| Additional procedures | Hemithyroidectomy ± thyroid cartilage removal |
| Postop concern | Hypocalcemia (possible parathyroid removal) |

### **Surgical Principles**
- Fourth branchial anomalies share many features with **third branchial cleft anomalies**, but the **tract passes below the superior laryngeal nerve** and **loops around major arteries**, increasing operative complexity.  
- **Complete excision** can be difficult—some authors question whether a full fourth tract has ever been entirely removed.

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** Fourth branchial anomalies are usually **left-sided** and deep, often involving great vessels.  
- **B:** A transoral approach alone is inadequate and unsafe.  
- **D:** Drain placement and fluoroscopy are useful and safe.  
- **E:** Parathyroid glands may be removed inadvertently; calcium levels should be monitored.

**Correct answer: C — Excision involves a cosmetic neck incision, deep dissection looping around great vessels, identification of the tract by endoscopy, and may require hemithyroidectomy for complete removal.**
