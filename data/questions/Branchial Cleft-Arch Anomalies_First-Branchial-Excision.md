id: BCA-012
subject: Branchial Cleft/Arch Anomalies
correct: C
A: Paralysis of the facial nerve is induced to facilitate excision of first branchial cleft anomalies.
B: Incision for first branchial cleft anomaly excision should always be made below the mandible to avoid the parotid gland.
C: Excision requires detailed knowledge of the facial nerve and parotid anatomy, careful dissection toward the external auditory canal, and cosmetic incision planning.
D: Tracts of first branchial cleft anomalies always lie superficial to the facial nerve and terminate lateral to the ear canal.
E: Complete excision can be reliably achieved in a single operation in nearly all cases.

A 7-year-old girl presents with a draining sinus near the angle of the mandible. Imaging shows a tract coursing through the parotid gland toward the external auditory canal. Which of the following statements best describes the principles of surgical excision for this type of lesion?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**First branchial cleft anomalies** are among the most technically challenging congenital neck lesions to excise due to their **intimate relationship with the facial nerve, parotid gland, and external auditory canal**. Successful excision requires meticulous preoperative planning and anatomic knowledge.

### **Operative Planning**
- **Preparation and exposure:**  
  The **surgical field** should be prepped to include the **lateral canthus of the eye** and **corner of the mouth**, allowing full visualization of the facial nerve’s potential course.  
  **Avoid facial nerve paralysis** intraoperatively to allow for **nerve monitoring with a stimulator**.

- **Incision and exposure:**  
  The **skin incision** is ideally placed in a **preauricular crease**, extending either into the **hairline** or **a cervical skin crease** below the **angle of the mandible**. Incision modifications are guided by lesion extent, but **cosmetic considerations** remain important.  
  Deep lesions may necessitate **exposure of the facial nerve trunk** and **superficial parotidectomy** to access the tract safely.

- **Dissection principles:**  
  - Dissection proceeds **toward the external auditory canal (EAC)**.  
  - Tracts may lie **deep to the facial nerve** or even **split around it**, requiring extreme precision.  
  - If the **tympanic membrane** or **cartilaginous EAC** is involved, **skin and cartilage resection** may be required.  
  - In cases where the tract extends to the **middle ear**, **transection and ligation** at the tympanic membrane may be necessary, sometimes followed by a **second-stage procedure** to remove the medial portion.

- **Closure:**  
  Wound closure may require placement of a **drain** to prevent seroma or hematoma formation. **Cosmetic alignment** of the incision is emphasized.

### **Surgical Challenges and Outcomes**
- **Facial nerve injury risk:** 10–40%, depending on lesion depth and nerve identification.  
- **Multiple operations** may be required for complete excision due to branching tracts or incomplete prior resections.  
- **Parotidectomy** (superficial or total) may be necessary for deep or recurrent lesions.  

| **Key Step** | **Surgical Consideration** |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Preoperative setup | Include eye to mouth for full nerve visualization |
| Intraoperative nerve monitoring | Avoid paralysis; use stimulator |
| Incision | Preauricular → hairline or submandibular crease |
| Deep exposure | May require superficial parotidectomy |
| Canal involvement | Remove affected EAC skin/cartilage ± tympanic membrane transection |
| Closure | May require drain; cosmetic closure preferred |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** Facial nerve paralysis is avoided; nerve monitoring is essential.  
- **B:** Incision placement is preauricular, not necessarily below the mandible.  
- **D:** Tracts may pass deep to or split around the facial nerve.  
- **E:** Multiple operations are often required for complete excision.

**Correct answer: C — Excision requires detailed knowledge of the facial nerve and parotid anatomy, careful dissection toward the external auditory canal, and cosmetic incision planning.**
