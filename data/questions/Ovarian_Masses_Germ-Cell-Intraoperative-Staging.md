id: OM-037
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: B
A: Frozen section evaluation should be avoided to prevent tumor spillage
B: Intraoperative staging includes careful inspection, cytology sampling, omentum and lymph node assessment, and fertility preservation when possible
C: The contralateral ovary should always be removed to prevent recurrence
D: Tumor capsule rupture during resection is acceptable if gross margins are clear
E: Lymph node sampling is unnecessary unless metastasis is radiographically proven preoperatively

During laparotomy for a suspected malignant ovarian germ cell tumor in a 14-year-old girl, the surgeon notes a large right ovarian mass without ascites or peritoneal implants. Which of the following best describes the appropriate **intraoperative management and staging protocol**?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Surgical staging** of ovarian germ cell tumors (GCTs) aims to achieve two simultaneous goals:  
1. **Accurate intraoperative assessment and staging** of the disease.  
2. **Maximal tumor resection** with **fertility preservation** when feasible.  

The key steps include:  
- **Removal of the involved ovary** (± fallopian tube) **without violating the capsule** or causing tumor spillage.  
- **Sampling of pelvic fluid or ascites** for cytology, or **obtaining pelvic washings** if no free fluid is present.  
- **Inspection of the omentum** with biopsy of any suspicious nodules.  
- **Evaluation of the contralateral ovary**, biopsying only if it appears abnormal.  
- **Examination of peritoneal surfaces** with biopsy of abnormal areas.  
- **Assessment of iliac and retroperitoneal lymph nodes**, biopsying any that are enlarged or abnormal.  

This meticulous process ensures accurate **Children’s Oncology Group (COG)** staging, which determines the need for adjuvant chemotherapy and prevents overtreatment or understaging. **Capsule rupture** or **tumor spillage** upstages disease, mandating more intensive therapy. Routine removal of the contralateral ovary or random biopsies of normal-appearing tissue are **not indicated**, as they do not improve survival.  

| **Staging Step** | **Purpose** |
|------------------|-------------|
| Oophorectomy ± salpingectomy | Complete removal of primary tumor |
| Cytology (washings) | Detect microscopic peritoneal spread |
| Omentum assessment | Identify extra-ovarian involvement |
| Contralateral ovary inspection | Detect synchronous disease |
| Lymph node evaluation | Detect occult metastases |

**Correct answer: B — Intraoperative staging includes careful inspection, cytology sampling, omentum and lymph node assessment, and fertility preservation when possible.**
