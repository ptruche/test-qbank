A 12-year-old girl presents with intermittent lower abdominal pain and occasional vomiting. Ultrasound reveals a 6 cm complex ovarian lesion. The attending notes that this is the most common presentation for ovarian neoplasms in children. Which of the following is correct regarding presentation?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Abdominal pain** is the most common presenting symptom of ovarian neoplasms in children, occurring in more than half of cases. Pain may be acute (from torsion, rupture, or hemorrhage) or chronic (from capsular distension or pressure on adjacent organs). Secondary symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, or urinary urgency are less frequent. A **palpable mass** is the next most frequent finding, occurring in about 25% of cases overall and more than 50% of those under ten years old. While many benign lesions may mimic these symptoms, malignancy risk increases with size (>8 cm) or when the presenting complaint is a mass rather than pain.

**Correct answer: C â€” Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom of ovarian neoplasms in children.**
