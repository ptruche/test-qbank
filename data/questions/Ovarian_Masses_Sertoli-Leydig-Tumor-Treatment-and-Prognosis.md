A 17-year-old girl undergoes resection of a Stage Ia, well-differentiated **Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor**. Genetic testing confirms a **DICER1 mutation**. What is the most appropriate management and prognosis?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (SLCTs)** are typically **low-stage, unilateral**, and have an **excellent prognosis**. For **Stage Ia**, **unilateral oophorectomy or adnexectomy** is **curative** and preserves fertility. Bilateral oophorectomy is **not indicated** unless there is bilateral disease or poor differentiation.  

Prognosis is highly dependent on **stage and histologic pattern**:  
- **Well-differentiated tumors** → benign course, >95% survival.  
- **Poorly differentiated tumors** or those with **heterologous elements (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma)** → increased recurrence risk and more aggressive therapy.  
- **Stage Ia tumors** → ~95% 5-year survival; overall mortality <5%.  

**Adjuvant therapy:** Reserved for **advanced or poorly differentiated tumors**. Platinum-based chemotherapy may be used in these cases. **Oral contraceptives** and **GnRH agonists** may help **protect ovarian function** during or after chemotherapy.  

| **Factor** | **Impact on Prognosis** |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Stage | Ia = Excellent, Advanced = Worse |
| Differentiation | Well = Benign, Poor = Aggressive |
| Heterologous elements | Worsen prognosis |
| Treatment | Surgery ± chemo (stage dependent) |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/B/C:** Bilateral surgery and routine chemotherapy are unnecessary in early-stage disease.  
- **E:** Hormonal therapy can support ovarian recovery.

**Correct answer: D — Unilateral oophorectomy is adequate for low-stage, well-differentiated tumors; prognosis is excellent.**
