During exploration for a right-sided ovarian tumor, what is the recommended management of the contralateral ovary?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Per **Children’s Oncology Group (COG)** surgical guidelines, the **contralateral ovary** should be **visually inspected** and **biopsied only if abnormalities are seen**. Routine biopsy of a normal-appearing ovary or omentum **does not improve survival** and may risk adhesions or infertility.

**Random biopsies** should be avoided. All suspicious areas should be documented, but extensive sampling of normal tissue adds morbidity without benefit.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A & D:** Routine bilateral biopsies risk loss of function.  
- **B:** Random biopsies do not change outcomes.  
- **E:** Omentectomy remains indicated for irregularities.

**Correct answer: C — The contralateral ovary should be visually inspected and biopsied only if abnormalities are present.**
