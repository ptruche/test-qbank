id: OM-005C
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: B
A: The presence of torsion implies a high likelihood of malignancy
B: Ovarian torsion is rarely associated with malignancy and warrants conservative management
C: Any ovarian mass larger than 5 cm should be considered malignant until proven otherwise
D: Ovarian masses discovered incidentally are almost always benign
E: A presenting complaint of pain predicts malignancy more than a mass

A 9-year-old girl presents with acute right lower quadrant pain. Imaging reveals an enlarged right ovary with absent blood flow consistent with torsion. The ovary appears cystic but viable. Which of the following is true regarding the malignancy risk in this scenario?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The rate of malignancy among patients with **ovarian torsion** is **very low (~1.7%)**, compared with over five times this rate among ovarian masses in general. This low association justifies an initial **ovarian-sparing approach** when torsion is diagnosed. In contrast, patients whose **chief complaint is a mass rather than pain** are more likely to have malignant tumors, particularly in the **1–8 year age group**. Larger size also increases suspicion: malignant tumors tend to exceed 8 cm in diameter. Tumor markers and imaging help stratify risk preoperatively.

| **Feature** | **Malignancy Risk** |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Torsion | **1.7%** (low) |
| Mass complaint (vs. pain) | Higher risk |
| Size > 8 cm | Higher risk |
| Endocrine symptoms | 50–60% malignant |

**Correct answer: B — Ovarian torsion is rarely associated with malignancy and warrants conservative management.**
