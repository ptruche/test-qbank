id: BCA-006
subject: Branchial Cleft/Arch Anomalies
correct: B
A: Fourth branchial cleft anomalies course above the superior laryngeal nerve and terminate in the tonsillar fossa.
B: Fourth branchial cleft anomalies follow a course parallel to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, passing below the superior laryngeal nerve and entering the pyriform sinus.
C: Fourth branchial cleft anomalies course anterior to the carotid artery and enter the external auditory canal.
D: Fourth branchial cleft anomalies are more common on the right and typically open into the tonsillar fossa.
E: Fourth branchial cleft anomalies pass above the hypoglossal nerve and terminate in the nasopharynx.

A 7-year-old boy presents with recurrent episodes of left-sided neck swelling and pain near the thyroid gland. Each episode follows an upper respiratory infection and improves with antibiotics but recurs within months. Imaging reveals a sinus tract extending from the thyroid region toward the pyriform sinus. Which of the following statements best describes the anatomic course of the underlying lesion?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Fourth branchial cleft anomalies** are exceedingly rare and represent incomplete obliteration of the **fourth branchial cleft and pouch**. They are closely related anatomically to the **recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN)**, and their course **mirrors** that of the nerve on both sides of the body.

### **Anatomic Course**
- On the **right side**, the tract passes **posterior to the carotid artery**, loops **around the subclavian artery**, and continues **superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve** and **deep to the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN)**. It then courses **past the hypoglossal nerve** before entering the **pyriform sinus**.  
- On the **left side**, the course is **similar** but the tract passes **around the aortic arch** before ascending toward the pyriform sinus.  
- The **internal opening** of both sides is at the **apex of the pyriform sinus**, typically **below the level of the superior laryngeal nerve**, distinguishing it from **third branchial cleft anomalies**, which enter **above** the SLN.

Although **complete fourth branchial fistulae** have rarely (if ever) been reported, the **theoretical pathway** of such a tract is derived from embryologic relationships between the **fourth pouch, aortic arch derivatives, and laryngeal nerves**.

| **Feature** | **Third Branchial Cleft** | **Fourth Branchial Cleft** |
|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Relation to SLN** | Above (cephalad) | Below (caudad) |
| **Relation to RLN** | Crosses above RLN | Parallel / superficial to RLN |
| **Course on Right** | Posterior to ICA | Posterior to ICA, around subclavian artery |
| **Course on Left** | Posterior to ICA | Around aortic arch |
| **Internal opening** | Pyriform sinus (above SLN) | Pyriform sinus (below SLN) |
| **Common presentation** | Recurrent neck abscess | **Recurrent suppurative thyroiditis**, left > right |

**Clinical presentation:**  
Fourth branchial anomalies often present in **childhood** or **adolescence** with **recurrent left-sided neck infections**, **abscesses**, or **suppurative thyroiditis**. The left-sided predominance reflects the longer embryologic course around the **aortic arch**. Symptoms may be triggered by upper respiratory infections and include **neck pain**, **swelling**, **dysphagia**, or **odynophagia**.

**Diagnosis:**  
**Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI** can help identify a tract extending from the **thyroid or pyriform sinus**. **Barium swallow** or **laryngoscopy** may demonstrate the sinus opening in the pyriform apex. Recognition of this pattern is crucial to avoid repeated incision and drainage procedures without definitive treatment.

**Management:**  
Initial management includes infection control with **antibiotics and drainage** if abscessed. Definitive treatment involves **endoscopic cauterization or surgical excision** of the tract and **closure of the pyriform sinus opening**.

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** Fourth branchial cleft tracts lie **below**, not above, the SLN and open into the **pyriform sinus**, not the tonsillar fossa.  
- **C:** They pass **posterior**, not anterior, to the carotid artery.  
- **D:** Left-sided predominance is typical, not right.  
- **E:** The tract courses **below** the hypoglossal nerve and ends in the **pyriform sinus**, not the nasopharynx.

**Correct answer: B â€” Fourth branchial cleft anomalies follow a course parallel to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, passing below the superior laryngeal nerve and entering the pyriform sinus.**
