A 17-year-old girl undergoes oophorectomy for a Stage IIIC serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma. What is the appropriate **medical therapy** for this condition?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Systemic chemotherapy** plays a critical role in the management of **advanced epithelial ovarian tumors**, including both adults and older adolescents. Following appropriate surgical resection and staging, **combination chemotherapy** with **cisplatin**, **cyclophosphamide**, and **paclitaxel** is the **standard regimen**. These agents act synergistically to reduce recurrence and improve survival, even though the overall prognosis for advanced disease remains guarded.

In pediatric and adolescent patients, **advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is uncommon**, and most cases present as **Stage I**. Thus, chemotherapy is reserved for **advanced-stage or recurrent disease**. The **most important prognostic factor** remains **tumor stage at diagnosis**.

**Targeted and hormonal therapy:**  
- **Aromatase inhibitors** (e.g., letrozole, anastrozole) have been used successfully for **borderline tumors** and **low-grade serous carcinomas**, primarily to **delay or prevent recurrence**.  
- Emerging **biologic agents** and **targeted therapies** (e.g., PARP inhibitors, anti-angiogenic drugs) are under investigation but not yet standard in pediatric practice.

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Cisplatin + Cyclophosphamide + Paclitaxel | Advanced epithelial carcinoma | First-line regimen |
| Aromatase inhibitors | Borderline, low-grade serous | Prevent recurrence |
| Targeted biologics | Refractory or recurrent cases | Investigational in pediatrics |

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Chemotherapy significantly improves outcomes in advanced disease.  
- **B:** Radiation plays no major role.  
- **D:** Most pediatric epithelial tumors are early-stage and do not need chemotherapy.  
- **E:** Hormonal therapy may help prevent recurrence in selected cases.

**Correct answer: C â€” Systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel is standard for advanced disease, while aromatase inhibitors may be used for low-grade or borderline tumors.**
