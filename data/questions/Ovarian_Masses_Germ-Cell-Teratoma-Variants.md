correct: D
A: Mature teratomas commonly secrete αFP and βhCG
B: Immature teratomas require adjuvant chemotherapy in all cases
C: Malignant teratomas are benign lesions containing only mature tissue
D: Immature teratomas contain neural elements and are treated surgically alone in pediatric patients

A 10-year-old girl undergoes oophorectomy for a cystic ovarian mass containing calcifications and hair. Pathology reveals immature neural elements and normal αFP. What is the correct statement regarding management?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Teratomas** represent **differentiation toward mature organ structures** derived from **mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm**.  
- **Mature teratomas (dermoid cysts):** Benign, cystic, with fat and calcification; αFP normal.  
- **Immature teratomas:** Contain **immature neural tissue** and may have **elevated αFP**. In **pediatric patients**, **surgical resection alone** is sufficient—even if **ruptured**—because adjuvant chemotherapy has **not been shown to reduce relapse risk**.  
- **Malignant teratomas:** Contain yolk sac or neural elements; treatment mirrors the most malignant component.  

| **Teratoma Type** | **Malignant Potential** | **Pediatric Management** |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Mature | None | Excision only |
| Immature | Low (grade-dependent) | Surgery alone |
| Malignant | High | Chemo per dominant element |

**Gliomatosis peritonei**, benign glial implants occasionally seen with teratomas, **do not worsen prognosis**.

**Correct answer: D — Immature teratomas contain neural elements and are treated surgically alone in pediatric patients.**
