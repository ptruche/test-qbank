A 10-year-old girl presents with a 6 cm cystic ovarian mass. Imaging and tumor markers are reassuring. Which surgical principle best reflects the management priority for this patient?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **primary goals of pediatric ovarian tumor surgery** are:
1. **Completely and accurately stage disease**,  
2. **Safely and completely resect the tumor**, and  
3. **Preserve all uninvolved reproductive organs**.

In nearly all pediatric patients, **fertility preservation is the priority** unless **preoperative findings suggest malignancy**. Benign or indeterminate lesions with normal tumor markers and reassuring imaging should be managed with **ovarian-sparing excision**.  

In contrast, **large, invasive tumors**—particularly those **encasing vessels or fixed to adjacent viscera**—should **not** be forcibly resected at the initial operation. Instead, **biopsy** should be obtained for diagnosis, and **definitive resection** delayed until **after neoadjuvant chemotherapy**.  

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Bilateral oophorectomy is rarely indicated.  
- **B:** Even some malignant tumors may permit unilateral resection.  
- **D:** Uterine removal is unnecessary.  
- **E:** Contralateral ovary should be inspected visually and biopsied only if abnormal.

**Correct answer: C — Fertility preservation should be prioritized unless preoperative findings suggest malignancy.**
