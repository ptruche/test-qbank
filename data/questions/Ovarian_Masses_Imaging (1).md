A 13-year-old girl presents with increasing lower abdominal fullness and intermittent pain. Ultrasound reveals an 8.5 cm complex left adnexal mass with irregular borders, internal septations, and areas of solid echogenicity but no ascites. Tumor markers are pending. The lesion’s origin cannot be confidently distinguished from adjacent bowel on ultrasound.  

What is the next best imaging study to further characterize this lesion and guide surgical planning?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

MRI is the optimal next imaging modality for further characterization of an indeterminate ovarian mass identified on ultrasound, especially when the lesion’s origin or composition cannot be clearly delineated. MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging, allowing accurate distinction between ovarian, uterine, and extra-ovarian pathology. It also identifies key features predictive of malignancy such as solid components, irregular septations, papillary projections, necrosis, or invasion into adjacent organs. Importantly, MRI is not influenced by body habitus or bowel gas, making it particularly valuable when ultrasound findings are equivocal.

In pediatric ovarian tumors, ultrasound remains the initial study of choice due to its accessibility, absence of radiation, and ability to differentiate cystic versus solid structures. However, CT or MRI are indicated when ultrasound cannot define the lesion’s origin, complexity, or extent. CT provides better spatial overview of the abdomen and chest but exposes the child to ionizing radiation, while MRI offers detailed anatomic definition without radiation and is preferred for pelvic assessment. MRI also assists in preoperative risk stratification by delineating capsular integrity, the presence of ascites, and lymphadenopathy—features that influence the decision between ovarian-preserving resection and salpingo-oophorectomy.

Features favoring benignity on imaging include thin-walled simple cysts, anechoic fluid, and smooth margins. Conversely, malignancy is suspected when imaging demonstrates thick septations, solid elements, papillary projections, irregular borders, or free fluid. Although lesion size >8 cm raises concern, it must be interpreted within the context of morphology, as even large benign cystadenomas may exceed 20 cm. Therefore, MRI refines interpretation by providing high-resolution assessment of soft tissue planes and guides operative planning to prevent inadvertent rupture or underestimation of disease extent. Chest CT is typically reserved for staging once malignancy is confirmed or strongly suspected. PET-CT, while occasionally useful for recurrent disease or equivocal postoperative findings, has limited value in initial diagnosis.

Proper preoperative imaging guides safe surgical decision-making. Attempting laparoscopic excision of a potentially malignant mass without adequate characterization risks rupture and upstaging, necessitating adjuvant chemotherapy. Conversely, overly aggressive oophorectomy in benign lesions compromises ovarian reserve. Thus, MRI not only refines diagnosis but also balances oncologic safety and fertility preservation in pediatric patients. Multidisciplinary review—including surgery, radiology, and oncology—should occur prior to intervention.

**Correct answer: C — MRI pelvis provides superior soft-tissue characterization and delineates lesion extent without radiation exposure, enabling accurate preoperative planning.**
