id: OM-048
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: C
A: Sex cord tumors with annular tubules are benign, unilateral tumors unrelated to any syndrome
B: These tumors are derived exclusively from granulosa cells and have no malignant potential
C: Sex cord tumors with annular tubules can show granulosa or Sertoli differentiation, are associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and may be malignant when sporadic
D: When associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, these tumors are typically unilateral and large
E: All patients with these tumors require chemotherapy after surgical excision

A 10-year-old girl with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome undergoes oophorectomy for a small calcified ovarian lesion discovered incidentally. Pathology reveals a **sex cord tumor with annular tubules**. Which of the following statements best characterizes this tumor type?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Sex cord tumors with annular tubules (SCTATs)** are **rare variants** of sex cord–stromal tumors that exhibit **bidirectional differentiation** toward both **granulosa** and **Sertoli cells**. These tumors form distinctive **annular (ring-like) tubular structures** microscopically.  

Two major clinical contexts exist:  

1. **Associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS):**  
   - **Small, multifocal, bilateral**, and often **calcified**.  
   - Usually **benign** and discovered **incidentally** (e.g., during surgery or autopsy).  
   - May cause **menstrual irregularities** or mild **hyperestrogenism**.  
   - **Surgical treatment is rarely indicated.**  

2. **Sporadic (non-syndromic) form:**  
   - **Larger (>5 cm)**, **unilateral**, and occurs in **older patients** (mean age ≈ 34 years).  
   - **20% are malignant**, and outcomes are **poor**—approximately **50% mortality** despite therapy.  

| **Feature** | **Peutz-Jeghers–Associated SCTAT** | **Sporadic SCTAT** |
|--------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Laterality** | Bilateral, multifocal | Unilateral |
| **Size** | Small, often incidental | >5 cm |
| **Malignancy** | Rare | ~20% malignant |
| **Age group** | Younger (PJS) | Older (mean 34 years) |
| **Association** | Peutz-Jeghers syndrome | None |
| **Management** | Observation or conservative | Surgery ± adjuvant therapy |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/B/D/E:** The tumors may be malignant when sporadic, and only the PJS-associated type is typically small and bilateral. Chemotherapy is not universally indicated.

**Correct answer: C — Sex cord tumors with annular tubules can show granulosa or Sertoli differentiation, are associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and may be malignant when sporadic.**
