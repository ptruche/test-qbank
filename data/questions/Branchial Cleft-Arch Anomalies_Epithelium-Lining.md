subject: Branchial Cleft/Arch Anomalies
correct: C
A: All branchial anomalies are lined exclusively by keratinized squamous epithelium.
B: Branchial cysts are lined by ciliated columnar epithelium, while sinuses are lined by stratified squamous cells.
C: Branchial anomalies may be lined by either squamous or respiratory (ciliated columnar) epithelium, depending on the type of lesion.
D: Only second branchial cleft cysts are lined by respiratory epithelium.
E: The epithelial lining of branchial cysts is variable but typically non-secretory.

A 9-year-old child presents with a recurrently draining sinus tract along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Histologic examination of the excised tract reveals ciliated columnar epithelium with mucous-producing glands. Which of the following best describes the expected epithelial lining of branchial anomalies?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Branchial cleft anomalies** arise from incomplete involution of the branchial apparatus during embryologic development. Their epithelial lining reflects the embryologic derivation of the tract and can help explain their clinical presentation.

### **Epithelial Lining Patterns**
Branchial anomalies are typically lined by **either squamous or respiratory epithelium**, depending on the nature of the lesion:

| **Type of Lesion** | **Typical Epithelial Lining** | **Clinical Implication** |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Cysts** | **Stratified squamous epithelium** | Non-secretory; prone to infection or enlargement if blocked |
| **Sinuses / Fistulae** | **Ciliated columnar (respiratory-type) epithelium** | Secretory; mucous drainage or discharge common |

Because **sinuses and fistulae** often contain **ciliated, mucin-producing cells**, they can produce **mucoid or serous drainage**, explaining why these lesions frequently **drain intermittently or enlarge suddenly**. In contrast, **cysts** (closed epithelial sacs) tend to enlarge slowly as epithelial secretions accumulate or become infected.

### **Pathophysiology**
The **epithelial secretions** produced by respiratory-type lining are responsible for:
- **Sinus tract drainage** (clear or mucoid fluid)  
- **Cyst enlargement**, especially when outflow is obstructed  
- **Recurrent inflammation or infection** due to mucus stasis  

**Histologically**, the presence of **lymphoid tissue** within the cyst wall further supports their branchial origin.

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** Not all branchial anomalies are squamous-lined; many contain respiratory epithelium.  
- **B:** The opposite relationship is true—cysts are squamous-lined, while sinuses are respiratory-lined.  
- **D:** All branchial anomalies may exhibit respiratory epithelium, not just second cleft cysts.  
- **E:** Many lesions are secretory due to the presence of mucous glands.

**Correct answer: C — Branchial anomalies may be lined by either squamous or respiratory (ciliated columnar) epithelium, with cysts typically squamous-lined and sinuses or fistulae lined by ciliated, columnar epithelium.**
