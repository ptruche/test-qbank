A 10-year-old girl presents with a complex adnexal mass on ultrasound. She is hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic. What is the most important purpose of **preoperative diagnostic evaluation** in this setting?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

In pediatric and adolescent patients with ovarian lesions, **preoperative diagnostic evaluation** aims to **stratify the risk of malignancy** to guide the **extent of surgery**. This strategy ensures **maximal ovarian preservation** in benign disease while allowing **complete oncologic staging and resection** when malignancy is suspected.

**Key components** of preoperative evaluation include:
1. **High-quality imaging** — typically **pelvic ultrasound** followed by **MRI** if further anatomic delineation is needed. Imaging evaluates lesion size, complexity, solid versus cystic nature, septations, and ascites.
2. **Laboratory assessment** — including **AFP, β-hCG, LDH, CA-125, CA 19-9, CEA, estradiol, testosterone, Inhibin A/B**, which help identify the tumor lineage (germ cell, epithelial, or sex cord–stromal).
3. **Clinical correlation** — incorporating **patient age**, **symptoms**, and **physical findings** (mass vs pain) to estimate malignancy likelihood.

| **Preoperative Goal** | **Benign Lesion** | **Malignant Lesion** |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Surgical approach | Ovarian-sparing resection | Oncologic resection and staging |
| Tumor markers | Normal or mildly elevated | Markedly elevated (LDH, AFP, β-hCG) |
| Imaging findings | Simple cystic lesion, smooth borders | Solid, complex mass, ascites, nodularity |

A **multidisciplinary approach**—involving pediatric surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, and endocrinologists—is recommended to tailor operative planning. Mild marker elevations (e.g., CA-125, CEA) should be interpreted cautiously since benign conditions can cause similar findings. Conversely, **significant or multiple elevations** should prompt oncologic preparation.

Ultimately, **risk stratification before surgery** is the key to balancing fertility preservation against complete oncologic clearance. This approach improves outcomes and avoids both undertreatment and unnecessary oophorectomy in benign disease.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Imaging is crucial for determining lesion complexity and extent.  
- **B:** Tumor markers are adjuncts, not stand-alone diagnostics.  
- **D:** Negative markers do not exclude malignancy.  
- **E:** These are routine checks but not the main purpose of evaluation.

**Correct answer: C — Preoperative risk stratification using imaging and laboratory studies guides surgical planning and ovarian preservation.**
