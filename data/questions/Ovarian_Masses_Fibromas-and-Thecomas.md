A 17-year-old girl presents with secondary amenorrhea, hirsutism, and a firm, solid adnexal mass on examination. Imaging reveals a calcified ovarian lesion. Which of the following statements best characterizes **fibromas and thecomas**?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Fibromas** and **thecomas** are **rare benign sex cord–stromal tumors** that together comprise approximately **14% of these tumor types in pediatric patients**. They are extremely uncommon in individuals under 20 years of age.  

- **Fibromas** are **firm, solid, whorled tumors**, often **calcified**, and may be **bilateral or multicentric**. They are associated with **basal cell nevus syndrome** (Gorlin syndrome).  
- **Thecomas**, in contrast, are typically **hormonally active**, producing **estrogen or androgens**, depending on the degree of luteinization. **Luteinized thecomas** are more common in younger females and may present with **amenorrhea**, **hirsutism**, or **menstrual irregularities**.  

| **Feature** | **Fibroma** | **Thecoma** |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Typical age** | Adults; rare in <20 yrs | Postmenopausal; occasional in teens |
| **Hormonal activity** | Usually none | Estrogenic or androgenic |
| **Association** | Basal cell nevus syndrome | None specific |
| **Laterality** | Often bilateral | Usually unilateral |
| **Treatment** | Unilateral oophorectomy | Unilateral oophorectomy |

**Management:**  
- **Unilateral oophorectomy** is curative for both lesions.  
- For **bilateral fibromas**, resection of tumor tissue with preservation of normal ovarian parenchyma preserves fertility.  
- Recurrence is rare and treated by reoperation. **Virilizing or menstrual symptoms** typically resolve after tumor removal.  

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/D:** Both tumors are benign and do not require radical or chemotherapeutic treatment.  
- **B/E:** Thecomas can cause hormonal symptoms, especially in luteinized variants.  

**Correct answer: C — Fibromas and thecomas are rare benign sex cord–stromal tumors, sometimes bilateral, with calcification and potential hormonal effects.**
