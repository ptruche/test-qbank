A 7-year-old girl presents with a recurrently infected mass on the right side of her neck that drains a small amount of mucoid fluid. On examination, the tract is located anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, near its lower third. Ultrasound shows a cystic lesion extending medially toward the pharynx. Which of the following best describes the typical presentation of this type of lesion?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Branchial anomalies** are congenital epithelial remnants from incomplete obliteration of the branchial apparatus. They typically present as **cysts, sinuses, or fistulae**, and their location helps determine which cleft or pouch is involved.

**First branchial cleft anomalies** arise between the external auditory canal and the submandibular region. They may present as a cyst or draining sinus near the angle of the mandible or within the parotid gland and may cause **chronic otorrhea** if connected to the ear canal.

**Second branchial cleft anomalies** are by far the most common, representing approximately **90–95%** of branchial cleft lesions. They typically present as **cysts, sinuses, or fistulae located anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the lower neck**, often near the carotid bifurcation. In infected cases, swelling, tenderness, and purulent drainage may occur. **Complete fistulae** track from an external opening at the skin in the lower neck to an internal opening at the **tonsillar fossa**.

**Third branchial cleft anomalies** are rare and usually present lower in the neck, with tracts coursing posterior to the internal carotid artery and entering the **pyriform sinus** above the superior laryngeal nerve. **Fourth branchial cleft anomalies** are even rarer and open into the **pyriform sinus** below the superior laryngeal nerve, sometimes causing **recurrent left-sided neck infections or suppurative thyroiditis** due to their proximity to the thyroid gland.

| **Branchial Anomaly** | **Typical External Location** | **Internal Opening** | **Distinguishing Features** |
|------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| First Cleft | Near angle of mandible / parotid | External auditory canal | Otorrhea, parotid involvement |
| Second Cleft | Anterior to SCM, lower neck | Tonsillar fossa | Most common type (90%) |
| Third Cleft | Lower neck, posterior to ICA | Pyriform sinus (above SLN) | Rare, may mimic 2nd cleft |
| Fourth Cleft | Low neck or mediastinum | Pyriform sinus (below SLN) | May cause recurrent thyroiditis |

**Diagnosis** is based on clinical presentation, anatomic location, and imaging. **Ultrasound** can delineate cystic versus solid components, while **CT or MRI** can help define tract course before surgery. **Definitive management** is **complete surgical excision**, which often requires identifying and removing the entire epithelial tract to prevent recurrence.

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** Describes features of first branchial cleft anomalies, not second.
- **B:** Third branchial cleft lesions drain into the pyriform sinus, not the tonsillar fossa.
- **D:** Fourth branchial anomalies open into the pyriform sinus, not near the parotid gland.
- **E:** No branchial cleft lesion typically presents in the suprasternal notch.

**Correct answer: C — Second branchial cleft anomalies present along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the lower neck, often with a tract to the tonsillar fossa.**
