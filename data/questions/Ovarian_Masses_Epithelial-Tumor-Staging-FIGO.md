correct: D
A: Pediatric epithelial ovarian tumors are staged using the Children’s Oncology Group germ cell tumor system
B: Stage IC disease is defined only by bilateral ovarian involvement
C: FIGO Stage IIIB includes microscopic peritoneal metastases above the pelvic brim
D: Epithelial ovarian tumors are staged using the FIGO system, where Stage IC includes surgical spill, capsule rupture, or malignant cells in ascites
E: Stage IV disease includes any tumor that involves the omentum

A 17-year-old adolescent with a mucinous epithelial ovarian tumor is found to have malignant cells in peritoneal washings but no extra-ovarian spread. According to the **FIGO (2014)** staging system for epithelial ovarian tumors, what is the correct stage?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Unlike **pediatric germ cell tumors**, which are staged using the **Children’s Oncology Group (COG)** system, **epithelial ovarian tumors** are staged according to the **adult FIGO (2014) classification**. This system is based on the **anatomic extent of disease**, incorporating both **laterality and spread**. Each FIGO stage corresponds to a proposed TNM classification.

| **FIGO Stage** | **Definition** |
|----------------|----------------|
| **I** | Tumor limited to the ovaries or fallopian tubes |
| **IA** | One ovary/tube involved; capsule intact; no surface tumor; negative cytology |
| **IB** | Both ovaries/tubes involved; capsules intact; negative cytology |
| **IC** | Limited to ovaries/tubes **with any of:** surgical spill (IC1), preoperative rupture or surface tumor (IC2), or malignant cells in ascites/washings (IC3) |
| **II** | Pelvic extension below the pelvic brim (uterus or pelvic peritoneum) |
| **III** | Peritoneal spread outside pelvis or retroperitoneal nodal metastasis |
| **IV** | Distant metastases (pleural cytology positive, parenchymal spread, or extra-abdominal nodes) |

In this case, **malignant cells in peritoneal washings** but no other spread defines **Stage IC3 disease**.

**Key differences from COG staging:**
- **Epithelial tumors** → FIGO (anatomic, adult model).  
- **Germ cell tumors** → COG (residual disease, cytology, and nodal status–based).  
- The **Italian pediatric network** has applied the **COG system** to epithelial tumors for consistency in pediatric trials, but the FIGO standard remains reference.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** The COG system is for germ cell, not epithelial tumors.  
- **B:** Bilaterality defines Stage IB.  
- **C:** Stage IIIB refers to **macroscopic** peritoneal disease ≤2 cm.  
- **E:** Omental involvement is Stage III, not IV.

**Correct answer: D — Epithelial ovarian tumors are staged using the FIGO system, where Stage IC includes surgical spill, capsule rupture, or malignant cells in ascites.**
