A previously healthy girl presents with 2 weeks of intermittent lower abdominal pain. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrates a right adnexal lesion whose appearance varies across patients as described in the options. No patient has systemic symptoms or ascites on exam. Based on age-specific malignancy risk patterns in pediatric ovarian tumors, which patient profile carries the highest pretest probability that the ovarian mass is malignant?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The pretest probability of malignancy in a pediatric ovarian mass is powerfully modulated by **age**, with a counterintuitive pattern: although **overall tumor incidence rises in adolescence**, the **proportion of neoplastic lesions that are malignant is highest in the prepubertal window (≈1–8 years)** and lower in older children and teens. Large registry and cohort data demonstrate (i) an overall pediatric malignancy rate of roughly **10–20%** among neoplastic ovarian lesions, (ii) **11%** malignant across a large <19-year cohort, but **≈22%** malignant in **prepubertal girls (1–8 years)** versus **≈10%** malignant in those **≥9 years**, and (iii) a low absolute incidence in the <9-year group (∼**0.102 per 100,000**) that rises in 10–19-year-olds (∼**1.072 per 100,000**). Thus, when a **prepubertal** patient harbors a **solid ovarian mass**, the baseline probability of malignancy is highest. In contrast, adolescents more commonly have benign pathology (eg, mature teratoma) despite a higher frequency of ovarian masses overall.

**Why B is correct.** The **7-year-old** with a **predominantly solid ovarian mass** and **elevated LDH** most closely fits the epidemiology of pediatric ovarian malignancy. Germ cell tumors dominate under age 20 (≈**75%** of ovarian neoplasms in this age group), and within that class, **dysgerminoma** is a quintessential tumor with frequent **LDH elevation**. Solid morphology further heightens concern. In a prepubertal patient, the combination of age + solid architecture + tumor marker signal (even if nonspecific) confers the **highest pretest probability of malignancy** among the options.

**Why the other options are less likely malignant.**
- **A (4-year-old with a simple cyst):** While malignancy under five years is rare to begin with, a **simple anechoic cyst**—particularly without solid elements, papillary projections, or ascites—is overwhelmingly **functional or benign**. Observation with interval ultrasound is typically appropriate in the absence of symptoms or concerning features.
- **C (13-year-old with fat-fluid and calcifications):** These sonographic features define a **mature cystic teratoma (dermoid)**, the most common adolescent ovarian neoplasm and **benign** in the vast majority. Adolescents carry a lower proportionate malignancy risk (~10%) than prepubertal children.
- **D (17-year-old with hemorrhagic cyst):** A classic **hemorrhagic cyst** temporally related to ovulation in an older teen nearly always resolves; the epidemiology and imaging are **benign**.
- **E (Neonatal simple cyst):** Most **neonatal ovarian cysts** are hormonally driven and regress postnatally; absent torsion or complex features, malignancy is **exceedingly rare**.

**Clinical reasoning and management implications.** Recognizing the **age–malignancy gradient** clarifies initial workup and operative decision-making. In a **prepubertal** child, a solid mass (especially ≥5–6 cm), elevated germ cell markers (AFP, β-hCG, LDH), or imaging signs of invasion/ascites should prompt expedited staging imaging and surgical planning aligned with pediatric oncology protocols. Conversely, in **adolescents**, classic benign patterns (eg, fat–fluid levels with calcifications in dermoid; hemorrhagic cyst with reticular “fishnet” echoes) favor ovary-sparing approaches and, at times, observation.

Germ cell tumors constitute **~75%** of pediatric ovarian neoplasms (vs ~20% in adults), whereas **epithelial tumors**, which dominate adult ovarian cancer and portend poorer prognosis, are **uncommon in adolescents** and **exceedingly rare prepubertally**. This histology shift explains the **generally better outcomes** in pediatric ovarian malignancies compared with adults and underscores why correct **pretest calibration by age** prevents both undertreatment (in younger children with solid masses) and overtreatment (in adolescents with benign lesions).

**Selected quantitative anchors to remember**
- **Incidence (malignant ovarian tumors):** ~**0.102/100,000** in girls **<9 years** vs **~1.072/100,000** in **10–19 years**; adults ≈ **11/100,000**.
- **Proportion malignant (neoplastic lesions):** **≈22%** in **1–8 years** vs **≈10%** in **≥9 years**.
- **Histology distribution under 20:** **~75% germ cell**; epithelial tumors rare before puberty.

**Syndromic risk associations (exam-favorite differentials):** While age drives baseline probability, specific **genetic syndromes** raise the index of suspicion for particular **sex cord–stromal** or other tumor types. The table below condenses clinically meaningful pairings that often appear in stems as subtle clues.

| Syndrome / Condition | Typical Ovarian Pathology Signal |
|---|---|
| **DICER1** | Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor |
| **Peutz–Jeghers** | Granulosa cell tumor; sex cord–stromal tumor with annular tubules; ovarian cystadenomas |
| **Ollier disease** (multiple enchondromatosis) | Juvenile granulosa cell tumor; Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor |
| **Maffucci syndrome** (enchondromatosis + hemangiomas) | Juvenile granulosa cell tumor; **fibrosarcoma** |
| **Chédiak–Higashi** | Sclerosing stromal tumor |
| **McCune–Albright** | Recurrent functional follicular cysts with estrogen excess; not all require resection |
| **Basal cell nevus syndrome** | Ovarian **fibroma** |

**Practical pearl.** Age is the first lens; morphology and markers refine it. A **prepubertal** child with a **solid ovarian mass** deserves rapid, oncology-aligned evaluation and operative planning that anticipates malignant germ cell tumor—while adolescents with classic benign imaging should be managed conservatively with ovary-sparing intent.

**Correct answer: B — Prepubertal (1–8 years) with a solid mass and LDH elevation carries the highest pretest probability of malignancy.**
