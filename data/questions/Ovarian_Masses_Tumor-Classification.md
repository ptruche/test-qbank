A 14-year-old girl presents with an adnexal mass found incidentally on ultrasound. Her serum AFP and β-hCG are elevated. The surgical team discusses the possible histologic types of ovarian tumors and their origins. Which of the following best describes how ovarian tumors are classified?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Ovarian tumors are classified according to their cell of origin**, a system that reflects their embryologic development and biologic behavior. This classification provides the foundation for both **diagnosis** and **treatment strategy** in pediatric and adult patients.

The three principal tumor categories include:

1. **Germ cell tumors** — arise from **primitive germ cells** of the gonad or yolk sac. These account for **60–77%** of pediatric ovarian neoplasms. Subtypes include **dysgerminoma**, **yolk sac tumor**, **immature teratoma**, and **mixed germ cell tumors**. These lesions often produce **AFP** or **β-hCG** and can present with rapid growth or torsion. Most are **chemosensitive** with excellent prognosis when diagnosed early.

2. **Sex cord–stromal tumors** — derived from the **stromal elements of the urogenital ridge**, including **granulosa**, **theca**, **Sertoli**, and **Leydig** cells. These tumors may secrete hormones (estrogen, progesterone, or androgens) and can present with **precocious puberty** or **virilization**. Examples include **juvenile granulosa cell tumors** and **Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors**.

3. **Epithelial tumors** — originate from the **germinal epithelium covering the ovary** and are more common in adults than in children. Pediatric cases are rare (≈15%) and usually benign (e.g., **serous or mucinous cystadenoma**). **Malignant epithelial tumors** such as serous or mucinous **adenocarcinomas** are uncommon in this age group.

| **Tumor Category** | **Cell of Origin** | **Typical Age Group** | **Representative Tumors** | **Key Features** |
|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Germ cell tumors | Primitive germ cells (yolk sac) | Children, adolescents | Dysgerminoma, Yolk sac tumor, Teratoma | 60–77% pediatric cases; AFP/β-hCG elevation |
| Sex cord–stromal tumors | Stromal elements of urogenital ridge | Infancy, adulthood | Granulosa cell, Sertoli-Leydig | Hormone-producing (precocity/virilization) |
| Epithelial tumors | Germinal epithelium covering ovary | Older teens, adults | Serous, mucinous, endometrioid | 15% of pediatric tumors; often benign |

Tumors of **mixed histology** may arise from more than one germ layer, and **extragonadal neoplasms** such as **lymphoma**, **leukemia**, or **metastatic lesions** (e.g., from gastrointestinal primaries) can also involve the ovary. Recognition of these categories is essential, as management differs significantly—**germ cell tumors** are generally treated with **surgery and chemotherapy**, **sex cord–stromal tumors** may require **hormone evaluation and resection**, and **epithelial tumors** are managed similarly to adult-type ovarian cancers with **surgical staging and cytoreduction**.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Classification by size or cystic appearance is descriptive but not biologically meaningful.  
- **C:** Stage and metastatic potential are prognostic, not classification criteria.  
- **D:** Hormone production occurs in sex cord–stromal tumors but is not a general classification system.  
- **E:** Chemotherapy response varies by type but does not define classification.

**Correct answer: B — Ovarian tumors are classified by their cell of origin, including germ cell, sex cord–stromal, and epithelial types.**
