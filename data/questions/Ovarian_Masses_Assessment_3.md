subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: B
A: Mildly elevated CA-125 or CEA confirms malignancy in children
B: Mild elevations in non-specific tumor markers can occur in benign conditions such as endometriosis or inflammation
C: All elevated tumor markers should prompt immediate oophorectomy
D: Tumor marker elevation should be interpreted independently of imaging
E: AFP and β-hCG elevations are usually non-specific in pediatric ovarian disease

A 15-year-old girl presents with a 7 cm ovarian cyst and mildly elevated CA-125. She has no systemic symptoms and imaging is otherwise unremarkable. Which of the following best interprets this laboratory result?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Mild elevation of **non-specific tumor markers** (such as **CA-125** and **CEA**) does **not necessarily indicate malignancy** and may result from **benign conditions** including **menstruation, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, or functional ovarian cysts**. Interpretation of tumor markers must always be **contextualized** with the clinical picture, physical exam, and imaging findings.

In contrast, **significant or disproportionate elevation** of specific markers—such as **AFP**, **β-hCG**, or **LDH**—should raise immediate concern for malignancy, prompting comprehensive staging and multidisciplinary discussion. The emphasis in pediatric evaluation is risk stratification: preserve ovarian function when benign disease is likely, and ensure oncologic completeness when malignancy is suspected.

| **Marker Type** | **Examples** | **Interpretation** |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Specific | AFP, β-hCG, LDH | Strongly predictive of malignancy |
| Non-specific | CA-125, CEA | May rise with benign inflammation or cysts |

**Correct answer: B — Mild elevations in non-specific tumor markers can occur in benign conditions such as endometriosis or inflammation.**
