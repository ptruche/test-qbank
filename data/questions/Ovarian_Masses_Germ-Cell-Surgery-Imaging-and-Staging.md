subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: D
A: Ultrasonographic findings of shadowing and bright echoes are definitive for malignancy
B: Laparoscopy should never be used in ovarian germ cell tumor surgery due to risk of tumor rupture
C: Tumor markers are not useful in preoperative risk assessment
D: Even when imaging suggests benign disease, ovarian masses should be approached with the possibility of malignancy and staged appropriately
E: Staging is unnecessary for lesions smaller than 5 cm

A 13-year-old girl presents with a 9-cm ovarian mass with mixed solid and cystic components on ultrasound. Tumor markers are normal, and there is no ascites or metastasis. Which principle best guides operative planning?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

While **preoperative imaging and tumor markers** can suggest benign versus malignant pathology, they are **not definitive**. Even when imaging favors a benign diagnosis—such as a mature teratoma—**malignant components may coexist**, particularly in **mixed germ cell tumors**.  

Therefore, **all pediatric and adolescent ovarian neoplasms should be approached with the potential for malignancy**, and **formal staging** should be performed when indicated. This ensures accurate diagnosis, appropriate adjuvant therapy, and optimal outcomes.  

**Ultrasound clues for benign lesions include:**  
- Shadowing echodensity (calcifications)  
- Fluid–fluid levels  
- Bright echoes (fat)  
- Hypoechoic lines and dots  

However, in malignant tumors, **mixed cystic and solid** appearance predominates, and imaging cannot reliably exclude malignancy in nongerminomatous tumors. Consequently, **surgeons should balance minimally invasive techniques with oncologic principles**, ensuring that capsular rupture or incomplete staging does not compromise outcomes.

**Correct answer: D — Even when imaging suggests benign disease, ovarian masses should be approached with the possibility of malignancy and staged appropriately.**
