subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: D
A: Sex cord-stromal tumors are typically nonfunctional and hormonally silent
B: They arise from germ cells of yolk sac origin
C: They account for over 50% of malignant ovarian tumors in children
D: These tumors originate from mesenchymal stem cells beneath the surface epithelium, often produce hormones, and may be associated with DICER-1 mutations
E: Feminizing tumors are more common after puberty, while virilizing ones occur before nine years of age

A 7-year-old girl presents with breast development and vaginal bleeding. Ultrasound reveals a unilateral ovarian mass. Histopathology demonstrates granulosa cell differentiation. Which of the following statements best describes **sex cord-stromal tumors** in children?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs)** represent a diverse group of **hormonally active ovarian neoplasms** that account for **5.7–17%** of malignant ovarian tumors in children. They arise from **uncommitted mesenchymal stem cells** beneath the **surface epithelium of the urogenital ridge** and include the **granulosa-theca cell** and **Sertoli-Leydig cell** subtypes.  

These tumors are referred to as **functioning ovarian tumors** due to their **systemic hormonal effects**. Their hormonal behavior is **age-dependent**:  
- **Before age 9:** predominantly **feminizing** tumors (e.g., granulosa-theca cell tumors) → precocious puberty, vaginal bleeding, or breast development.  
- **After age 9:** typically **virilizing** tumors (e.g., Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors) → hirsutism, deepened voice, or clitoromegaly.  

A subset of SCSTs is associated with **genetic predisposition syndromes**, most notably those with **DICER-1 mutations**, which also confer risk for other neoplasms such as **pleuropulmonary blastoma** and **thyroid neoplasia**. Thus, **genetic counseling and screening** for associated conditions are recommended.  

| **Feature** | **Sex Cord-Stromal Tumors** |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| **Origin** | Mesenchymal stem cells of urogenital ridge |
| **Subtypes** | Granulosa-theca, Sertoli-Leydig, fibrothecoma |
| **Hormonal Activity** | Feminizing (young girls), Virilizing (postpubertal) |
| **Associated Gene** | DICER-1 mutation |
| **Frequency (malignant)** | 5.7–17% of ovarian malignancies in children |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/B:** These tumors are functional and of mesenchymal—not germ cell—origin.  
- **C:** They are uncommon, comprising fewer than one-fifth of ovarian malignancies.  
- **E:** The hormonal pattern is reversed—feminizing before nine years, virilizing after.

**Correct answer: D — These tumors originate from mesenchymal stem cells beneath the surface epithelium, often produce hormones, and may be associated with DICER-1 mutations.**
