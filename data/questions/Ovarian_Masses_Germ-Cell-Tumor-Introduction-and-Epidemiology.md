A 12-year-old girl presents with an abdominal mass. Imaging reveals a complex ovarian lesion. Which of the following statements most accurately describes **pediatric ovarian germ cell tumors**?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Germ cell tumors (GCTs)** arise from **pluripotential primordial germ cells**, capable of differentiating into various tissue types. These tumors represent the **most common group of pediatric ovarian neoplasms**, accounting for **60–80%** of cases. Approximately **half of all germ cell tumors in girls arise in the ovary**, while the remainder occur in **extragonadal locations** (e.g., mediastinum, retroperitoneum, or sacrococcygeal region) due to aberrant migration of germ cells from their **yolk sac origin** to the gonadal ridge during embryogenesis.

**Epidemiology highlights:**
- The **incidence** of ovarian GCTs is approximately **1 in 100,000** in the pediatric population.  
- They represent **> two-thirds** of all pediatric ovarian neoplasms, with **16–24%** being malignant.  
- The **incidence rises with age**, peaking in **adolescence (15–19 years)**—a period when **mature teratomas** comprise ~90% of cases.  
- **Younger patients** have a **lower overall incidence**, but the **proportion of malignant histology** (e.g., yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma) is **higher**.  

| **Age Group (years)** | **% of Cases** | **Common Histology** |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 0–5 | 10% | Yolk sac, immature teratoma |
| 5–10 | 20% | Mixed or immature forms |
| 10–15 | 70% | Mature teratoma |
| 15–19 | — | Peak incidence, mostly benign |

There is emerging evidence that **dietary factors** (e.g., polyunsaturated fats) may increase the risk of teratoma development, though data remain limited. Additionally, **gonadoblastoma**—a carcinoma in situ occurring in **disorders of sexual development (DSD)**—can evolve into invasive germ cell tumors (e.g., yolk sac or choriocarcinoma).

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** GCTs are the most common pediatric ovarian tumor type.  
- **B:** They arise from **germ cells**, not epithelial cells.  
- **D:** Incidence **increases** with age until late adolescence.  
- **E:** While extragonadal sites occur, **most pediatric cases are ovarian**.

**Correct answer: C — Germ cell tumors arise from pluripotent primordial germ cells and represent 60–80% of pediatric ovarian neoplasms.**
