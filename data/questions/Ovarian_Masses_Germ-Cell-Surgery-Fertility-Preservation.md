Which statement best summarizes the key principles guiding the **surgical management** of ovarian germ cell tumors?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Two major principles define the **surgical management** of ovarian germ cell tumors (GCTs):  
1. **Extirpation of disease** (complete removal when possible)  
2. **Preservation of fertility** (conserving the uterus and contralateral ovary whenever feasible)

With **survival rates approaching 100%**, emphasis has shifted toward **fertility preservation** in both benign and malignant GCTs. When preoperative evaluation (negative tumor markers, benign imaging, absence of metastasis or ascites) suggests **mature teratoma**, a **minimally invasive approach** may be appropriate.  

**Ultrasound features** predictive of benignity include:  
- **Shadowing echodensity (calcifications)**  
- **Fluid–fluid levels**  
- **Bright echoes (fat content)**  
- **Hypoechoic lines and dots**  

The presence of two or more of these findings correlates with a **100% PPV** for mature/benign lesions in some studies. Nevertheless, because imaging cannot always differentiate mixed or malignant tumors, **all pediatric ovarian masses must be approached with the possibility of malignancy**, and **formal staging** should be performed when indicated.

**Correct answer: C — Surgical management emphasizes disease extirpation while preserving fertility whenever feasible.**
