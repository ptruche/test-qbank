Which of the following statements accurately describes the **biologic behavior and treatment** of **juvenile granulosa cell tumors**?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Juvenile granulosa cell tumors (JGCTs)** differ markedly from their adult counterparts in both **pathology** and **clinical behavior**. They account for a minority of ovarian neoplasms but are the **most common malignant sex cord-stromal tumor in children**.  

These tumors are **large (mean 12.5 cm)**, **unilateral (≈97%)**, and demonstrate **eosinophilic, luteinized cytoplasm** with a **high mitotic rate**. Unlike adult granulosa tumors, **DNA ploidy and cell-cycle analysis** do **not correlate** with prognosis in children.  

While the **adult type** typically follows an indolent course with late recurrences (>5 years), **juvenile tumors recur earlier** and exhibit more **aggressive behavior** related to tumor size, rupture, and mitotic activity.  

**Staging and treatment:**  
- Staged using **FIGO** (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) criteria.  
- **>90% present as Stage I**, conferring an excellent prognosis.  
- **Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy** is standard.  
- **Platinum-based chemotherapy** is reserved for **Stage Ic or higher** disease; its use in **Stage IC1** (capsular rupture only) remains controversial.  

| **FIGO Stage** | **5-Year Survival** |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Ia | 100% |
| Ic | 76% |
| II–III | 67% |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** Most are unilateral, not bilateral.  
- **B:** Chemotherapy is unnecessary for early-stage disease.  
- **C:** Juvenile tumors are more aggressive than adult forms.  
- **E:** DNA analysis is not prognostic in pediatric cases.

**Correct answer: D — Juvenile granulosa tumors are typically large, unilateral, more aggressive than adult forms, and managed with surgery ± chemotherapy based on FIGO stage.**
