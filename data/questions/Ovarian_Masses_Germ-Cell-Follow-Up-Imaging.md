subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: B
A: Routine CT scans every two weeks are required for two years after surgery
B: Ultrasonography every 3 months for 1 year, then annually for 5–8 years, is recommended for long-term surveillance
C: Imaging is unnecessary once tumor markers have normalized
D: MRI is preferred to ultrasound for routine follow-up of all cases
E: Late recurrence is rare and does not warrant surveillance beyond two years

A 14-year-old girl has undergone resection of a mature teratoma. Tumor markers remain normal, and she is asymptomatic. What is the most appropriate **imaging follow-up strategy**?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Postoperative imaging surveillance** for ovarian germ cell tumors balances early detection of recurrence with minimization of radiation exposure.  
While **tumor markers** (αFP, βhCG, LDH) are the primary means of detecting recurrence in malignant tumors, **ultrasonography** remains the mainstay of imaging surveillance due to its **sensitivity, safety, and accessibility**.

The **National Cancer Institute (NCI)** recommends:  
- **Ultrasound or CT/MRI every 3 months for 2 years**, then **annually for 5 years**, when tumor markers are normal.  
For **mature teratomas**, which grow slowly, imaging can be performed **less frequently but extended beyond 5 years**, as **late recurrences** have been reported.

| **Recommended Imaging Interval** | **Duration** |
|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Every 3 months | First year |
| Every 6–12 months | Years 2–5 |
| Annually or as indicated | Beyond 5 years (for mature teratoma) |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/D:** Frequent CT or MRI is not justified due to radiation and cost.  
- **C:** Imaging complements but does not replace marker follow-up.  
- **E:** Late recurrences, though rare, necessitate long-term surveillance.

**Correct answer: B — Ultrasonography every 3 months for 1 year, then annually for 5–8 years, is recommended for long-term surveillance.**
