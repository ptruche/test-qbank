id: BCA-014
subject: Branchial Cleft/Arch Anomalies
correct: C
A: Third branchial cleft anomalies are typically right-sided and superficial to the internal carotid artery.
B: The tract of a third branchial cleft anomaly passes below the superior laryngeal nerve and enters the tonsillar fossa.
C: Complete excision involves identifying the tract endoscopically at the pyriform sinus, dissecting deep to the internal carotid artery and glossopharyngeal nerve, and may require hemithyroidectomy.
D: The tract of a third branchial anomaly passes lateral to the carotid sheath and terminates in the external auditory canal.
E: Simple drainage and antibiotic therapy are sufficient for definitive management of most third branchial cleft anomalies.

A 10-year-old boy presents with recurrent left-sided neck abscesses. Imaging reveals a tract extending from the pyriform sinus toward the thyroid gland. During surgery, endoscopy confirms a sinus opening at the pyriform apex. Which of the following best describes the appropriate surgical approach for definitive management of this lesion?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Third branchial cleft anomalies** are rare congenital lesions, usually occurring on the **left side** of the neck. They may present as recurrent **abscesses or suppurative thyroiditis**, and definitive management requires **complete surgical excision** of the tract. Because of their close proximity to key neurovascular structures, careful dissection and preoperative localization are essential.

### **Preoperative Evaluation**
- **Endoscopic examination** is performed to identify the **internal opening** of the tract in the **pyriform sinus**.  
- **Contrast injection** into the tract may help delineate its course intraoperatively.  
- The differential diagnosis includes **second branchial cleft anomalies**, which are more superficial and anterior to the carotid vessels.

### **Surgical Technique**
- **Incision and exposure:**  
  A **cosmetic skin incision** is made to encompass any **draining site** or to access a **deep cystic lesion** in the lower neck.  
  The approach should allow wide exposure of the carotid sheath and surrounding structures.

- **Dissection course:**  
  The tract typically passes:  
  1. **Deep to the internal carotid artery**  
  2. **Deep to the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)**  
  3. **Above the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN)**  
  4. **Pierces the thyrohyoid membrane**  
  5. **Terminates at the pyriform sinus**  

  Because of these relationships, meticulous dissection is required to avoid injury to the **carotid artery**, **vagus**, **hypoglossal**, and **superior laryngeal nerves**.

- **Extent of resection:**  
  In some cases, the tract passes **adjacent to or through the thyroid gland**, requiring **partial or hemithyroidectomy** for complete removal.

| **Step** | **Key Considerations** |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Preoperative endoscopy | Identify pyriform sinus tract opening |
| Incision | Cosmetic, around draining site or cyst |
| Dissection | Deep to ICA and CN IX, above SLN |
| Ligation | At pyriform sinus opening |
| Additional procedure | Hemithyroidectomy if tract involves thyroid |

### **Postoperative Care**
- Monitor for **nerve injury** (CN IX, X, XII, SLN).  
- Assess for **recurrent infection or drainage**.  
- Recurrence is uncommon with **complete excision** and **identification of the internal opening**.

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** Third branchial anomalies are usually **left-sided** and **deep to** the ICA.  
- **B:** They course **above**, not below, the SLN and enter the **pyriform sinus**, not the tonsillar fossa.  
- **D:** They pass **deep**, not lateral, to the carotid sheath and do not involve the EAC.  
- **E:** Simple drainage is insufficient; **definitive excision** is required.

**Correct answer: C â€” Complete excision involves endoscopic localization of the pyriform sinus tract, dissection deep to the internal carotid and glossopharyngeal nerve, and may require hemithyroidectomy for complete removal.**
