A 13-year-old girl presents with increasing abdominal distension and a palpable lower abdominal mass. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is markedly elevated. Ultrasound reveals a complex cystic and solid mass arising from the right ovary. Histopathology confirms the diagnosis of yolk sac tumor. Which of the following best describes the embryologic origin of this neoplasm?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Yolk sac tumors (endodermal sinus tumors) are malignant germ cell neoplasms derived from **totipotent germ cells** that arise from the yolk sac endoderm and migrate to the developing gonad during embryogenesis. Errors in differentiation and proliferation during this process lead to neoplastic transformation. Germ cell tumors constitute approximately 70% of ovarian neoplasms in children and adolescents, though only about one-third are malignant. The most common malignant germ cell tumors are dysgerminoma and yolk sac tumor.

By contrast, **epithelial ovarian tumors** arise from the **coelomic (germinal) epithelium** covering the ovary and are far more common in adults, while **sex cord–stromal tumors** arise from the **mesenchymal stromal elements** of the urogenital ridge, such as granulosa or Sertoli–Leydig cells. These distinctions reflect the three embryologic sources of ovarian tumors: (1) germ cells (yolk sac origin), (2) gonadal stroma, and (3) surface (coelomic) epithelium. In children, the predominance of germ cell tumors reflects the active proliferative potential of these primitive cells.

| **Ovarian Tumor Lineages** | **Representative Tumors** |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Germ cell (yolk sac origin) | Yolk sac tumor, dysgerminoma, immature teratoma |
| Gonadal stroma | Granulosa cell tumor, Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor |
| Surface epithelium | Serous, mucinous, or endometrioid cystadenoma/carcinoma |

**Correct answer: B — Transformation of totipotent germ cells from yolk sac origin.**
