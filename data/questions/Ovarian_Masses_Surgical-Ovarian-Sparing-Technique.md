correct: D
A: Ovarian-sparing resection is contraindicated for lesions over 5 cm

A 9-year-old girl undergoes exploration for an 8 cm ovarian cyst with smooth margins and normal tumor markers. What is the preferred surgical management?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Ovarian-sparing resection** is recommended for **localized, benign-appearing lesions** with **negative tumor markers** and **reassuring imaging**. The mass typically has a **well-defined capsule** and can be **shelled out** from the thin ovarian parenchyma, which remains **viable** post-excision.  

It is **not necessary to reconstruct or close the ovarian remnant** after partial excision. The ovary’s blood supply and healing potential allow for preservation of hormonal and reproductive function.

**Incorrect answer explanations:**
- **A:** Size alone does not preclude ovarian-sparing surgery.  
- **B:** Closure is unnecessary and may damage remaining follicles.  
- **C:** The technique is used for unilateral, localized lesions.  
- **E:** Contralateral ovary should only be inspected, not removed.

**Correct answer: D — Localized, benign-appearing masses can be shelled out, preserving viable ovarian tissue.**
