A 15-year-old girl has an ovarian mass with elevated αFP and βhCG. Pathology reveals yolk sac and dysgerminoma components. What is the guiding principle for management?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Mixed germ cell tumors (MGCTs)** consist of **two or more germ cell elements**—most often **teratoma**, **yolk sac tumor**, and/or **dysgerminoma**.  
They account for over **50% of malignant ovarian GCTs** in pediatric series.

**Management principle:** Treatment and prognosis are determined by the **most malignant histologic component**. For instance, if a yolk sac tumor or embryonal carcinoma is present, the patient receives **cisplatin-based chemotherapy** per malignant GCT protocols.

| **Common Components** | **Associated Markers** |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Yolk sac | αFP |
| Choriocarcinoma | βhCG |
| Dysgerminoma | LDH |
| Teratoma | ± αFP if immature |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** Treatment is guided by the **most malignant**, not least malignant, component.  
- **B:** Yolk sac and dysgerminoma elements are **common**.  
- **D:** Marker expression varies by component.  
- **E:** MGCTs are malignant and require chemotherapy.

**Correct answer: C — Mixed germ cell tumors often contain yolk sac or dysgerminoma components, and treatment is based on the most malignant element.**
