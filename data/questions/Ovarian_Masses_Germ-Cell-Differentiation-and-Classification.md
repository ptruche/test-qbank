Which statement best summarizes the basis for classification of ovarian germ cell tumors?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

All **ovarian germ cell tumors (GCTs)** derive from **pluripotent primordial germ cells**, which have the ability to differentiate into **embryonic** or **extraembryonic** lineages. The **degree of differentiation** determines both **tumor classification** and **clinical behavior**.

| **Tumor Type** | **Differentiation Pathway** | **Common Marker(s)** |
|----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Dysgerminoma | Undifferentiated (primitive germ cell) | LDH |
| Yolk sac tumor | Extraembryonic (endodermal sinus) | αFP |
| Choriocarcinoma | Extraembryonic (trophoblastic) | βhCG |
| Embryonal carcinoma | Embryonic (fetal cell lines) | βhCG ± αFP |
| Teratoma | Somatic differentiation (mature tissues) | None (± αFP if immature) |

Thus, **dysgerminoma** is the least differentiated and most primitive, while **teratoma** is fully differentiated and usually benign. Tumors with **mixed histology** are classified and treated based on their **most malignant component**.

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A:** GCTs arise from germ cells, not epithelial precursors.  
- **B:** Dysgerminomas are undifferentiated.  
- **C:** Differentiation directly influences malignancy risk.  
- **E:** Gonadoblastomas contain both germ cell and sex cord–stromal elements.

**Correct answer: D — The degree of germ cell differentiation determines classification and correlates with tumor behavior.**
