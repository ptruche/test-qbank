id: OM-043
subject: Ovarian Masses
correct: C
A: Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors commonly occur bilaterally and present with estrogenic effects only
B: They account for over 10% of all ovarian malignancies
C: Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are rare, usually unilateral, often virilizing, and associated with DICER1 mutations
D: Tumor testosterone levels are unrelated to tumor volume
E: Most cases present as advanced-stage disease with poor prognosis

A 15-year-old girl presents with hirsutism, voice deepening, and secondary amenorrhea. Laboratory testing reveals elevated testosterone with low gonadotropins and normal urinary 17-ketosteroids. Imaging shows a unilateral ovarian mass. Which of the following statements best characterizes **Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors**?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (SLCTs)** are **rare sex cord–stromal neoplasms**, representing **<0.5% of all ovarian tumors** but approximately **10% of sex cord–stromal tumors**. They are typically **unilateral**, occur in **younger patients**, and are usually **Stage Ia** at diagnosis.  

Most SLCTs are **androgen-producing**, leading to **virilization** and **defeminization**. The clinical presentation includes **amenorrhea**, **hirsutism**, **clitoral enlargement**, and **voice deepening**. In prepubertal girls, **accelerated growth and virilization** predominate.  

**Hormonal findings:**  
- **↑ Testosterone** proportional to tumor volume (useful for monitoring).  
- **↓ Gonadotropins (LH, FSH)** due to feedback inhibition.  
- **Normal urinary 17-ketosteroids and pregnanetriol**.  
- **Tumor markers:** αFP and CA-125 may be elevated; LDH can be normal or mildly increased.  

**Genetics and associations:**  
- ~50% harbor **DICER1 mutations** (tumor or germline).  
- Associated with **Ollier’s disease** (enchondromatosis).  
- Heterologous elements (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma) confer a worse prognosis.  

| **Feature** | **Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumor** |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Incidence | <0.5% of ovarian tumors |
| Laterality | Unilateral |
| Hormonal activity | Androgenic (testosterone-producing) |
| Marker | αFP, CA-125 ± LDH |
| Genetic link | DICER1 mutation |

**Correct answer: C — Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are rare, usually unilateral, often virilizing, and associated with DICER1 mutations.**
