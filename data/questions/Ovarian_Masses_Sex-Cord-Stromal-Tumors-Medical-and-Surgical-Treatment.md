A: All pediatric sex cord-stromal tumors require postoperative chemotherapy regardless of stage
B: Most pediatric sex cord-stromal tumors are treated with unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy alone, with chemotherapy reserved for higher-stage or Sertoli-Leydig variants

A 13-year-old girl undergoes resection of an ovarian mass, which on pathology is a juvenile granulosa cell tumor confined to one ovary with an intact capsule. Which of the following statements best describes the optimal management approach?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs)** in pediatric patients generally have a **favorable prognosis**, with most presenting as **low-stage (IA or IB)** disease. Because of this, **surgical resection alone is curative in the majority of cases.**  

**Surgical treatment:**  
- **Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy** is the standard operation for tumors confined to one ovary.  
- A **staging laparotomy** should be performed at the time of diagnosis to evaluate for disease spread (including peritoneal washings, omental inspection, and biopsies of suspicious areas).  
- **European guidelines** recommend adding **adnexectomy** in cases where there is **pelvic adhesion or invasion**.  

**Adjuvant therapy:**  
- The role of **adjuvant chemotherapy** is **controversial in stage IC1 juvenile granulosa cell tumors**, but **recommended for all stage IC Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors**.  
- **Advanced-stage disease** is treated using **standard germ cell chemotherapy regimens**, such as **bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP)**.  
- Other platinum-based regimens include **PEI (cisplatin/etoposide/ifosfamide)**, **PEB (cisplatin/etoposide/bleomycin)**, and combinations with **vincristine, adriamycin, or paclitaxel/carboplatin**.  

**Additional considerations:**  
- **Regional deep hyperthermia** has been reported for **recurrent or refractory cases**, but it is **not standard therapy**.  
- **Second-look surgery** is indicated if **residual disease** is suspected or initial resection was incomplete.  

| **Stage** | **Typical Management** |
|------------|------------------------|
| IA/IB | Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ± staging laparotomy |
| IC1 Juvenile GCT | Surgery ± chemotherapy (controversial) |
| IC Sertoli-Leydig | Surgery + chemotherapy (BEP or equivalent) |
| II–IV | Surgery + platinum-based chemotherapy |
| Residual disease | Second-look surgery |

**Incorrect answers:**
- **A/C/D/E:** Chemotherapy is not routine for all cases; fertility-preserving unilateral surgery is preferred; hyperthermia is not first-line; and second-look surgery may be needed if resection was incomplete.

**Correct answer: B — Most pediatric sex cord-stromal tumors are treated with unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy alone, with chemotherapy reserved for higher-stage or Sertoli-Leydig variants.**
