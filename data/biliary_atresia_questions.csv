1,Biliary Atresia,"A 5-week-old term infant presents with persistent jaundice since day 10 of life, acholic stools, and a gamma-glutamyl transferase of 780 U/L. Abdominal ultrasound shows a small, irregular gallbladder and an echogenic triangular cord at the porta hepatis; Doppler demonstrates patent portal and hepatic arterial flow. After 5 days of phenobarbital priming, HIDA shows no excretion at 24 hours. The infant is well appearing and feeding, with normal coagulation on vitamin K. What is the most appropriate next step to establish the diagnosis and optimize outcomes?",Repeat HIDA in two weeks to reduce false negatives before surgical exploration,Schedule urgent diagnostic laparoscopy with intraoperative cholangiography and proceed to Kasai portoenterostomy if atresia is confirmed,Obtain MRCP as a definitive noninvasive test and operate only if positive,Trial of high-dose systemic steroids to reduce inflammatory biliary edema,Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography via duodenoscope to visualize the common bile duct,Correct Answer: B — Schedule urgent diagnostic laparoscopy with intraoperative cholangiography and proceed to Kasai portoenterostomy if atresia is confirmed.,"Correct answer: B — Early operative evaluation with intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), and immediate Kasai portoenterostomy when atresia is confirmed, maximizes the chance of bile drainage and survival with native liver.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a time-sensitive surgical disease. The probability of successful bile drainage after Kasai declines with advancing age because progressive cholangiopathy and portal fibrosis narrow the biliary microchannels and increase lobular injury. Outcomes are consistently best when the portoenterostomy is performed early—ideally by 45–60 days of life in most series—and certainly without delay once nonexcretion on hepatobiliary scintigraphy and suggestive ultrasound findings (e.g., triangular cord sign, absent/irregular gallbladder) point strongly to BA. Waiting for further noninvasive testing rarely clarifies the diagnosis and risks losing the therapeutic window during which bile ductules at the porta hepatis remain salvageable.

The IOC remains the gold standard diagnostic test because it directly delineates the extrahepatic biliary tree. In suspected BA, the operation is planned as a combined diagnostic and therapeutic procedure: diagnostic laparoscopy (or mini-laparotomy) with cholangiography is performed; if ductal continuity to the intestine is absent or the extrahepatic ducts are fibrosed/atretic, the surgeon proceeds in the same anesthesia to a Kasai portoenterostomy. This single-stage approach avoids an unnecessary second anesthetic and, most importantly, prevents critical delays. The technical setup includes a 3–5 Fr catheter in the gallbladder (if present) or common duct remnant, low-pressure injection under fluoroscopy, and assessment for opacification of intrahepatic ducts and duodenal drainage. When no opacification is achieved, or the system terminates blindly, the diagnosis of BA is established.

Noninvasive adjuncts—HIDA scanning (even with phenobarbital priming), ultrasound, and increasingly shear-wave elastography—can raise or lower the pretest probability but cannot substitute for IOC when BA is likely. Liver biopsy can be highly suggestive (bile duct proliferation, portal fibrosis, bile plugs) and may be useful in equivocal cases or to differentiate neonatal hepatitis; however, in a 5-week-old with classic features and a nonexcreting HIDA, many centers proceed directly to operative cholangiography to avoid delay. Center experience and streamlined pathways are key; the most important modifiable factor in many systems is the speed from suspicion to the OR.

If BA is confirmed, immediate Kasai is indicated unless there is a contraindication (e.g., advanced cirrhosis precluding meaningful drainage). The operation entails complete excision of the fibrotic extrahepatic remnant and creation of a Roux-en-Y portoenterostomy to the portal plate. Early postoperative bile drainage—often evidenced by pigmented stools and falling bilirubin in weeks—predicts improved native liver survival. Postoperative management includes antibiotics (perioperative and often prophylactic), ursodeoxycholic acid, fat-soluble vitamin supplementation, and aggressive nutritional support.

Incorrect answers: A—Repeating HIDA adds time without meaningful additional diagnostic yield in a presentation already highly suggestive of BA; delay worsens outcomes. C—MRCP in neonates often lacks diagnostic resolution for tiny ducts and cannot reliably exclude BA; it should not delay IOC. D—Steroids have no role preoperatively to “unmask” excretion and may worsen infection risk; evidence for postoperative steroids is mixed and not relevant here. E—ERCP is technically challenging and often not feasible in small infants; it is not standard for diagnosing BA and risks procedural complications.

Summary takeaway: When BA is suspected and HIDA shows nonexcretion, the correct next step is urgent operative cholangiography with readiness to proceed to Kasai in the same anesthesia; time to surgery is a primary determinant of native liver survival.
